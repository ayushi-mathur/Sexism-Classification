Well, by 8pm Baby Handmade had been sick over his cot, choked on phlegm, cried his eyes out and would only settle on Mummy in Mummy\\'s bed. So I laid there on the bed. In the dark.

But today there’s less of me thinking it’s what I deserved, that I should’ve done something different, or that I could’ve been more aggressive. Instead, I’m allowing myself more compassion with the knowledge that I was terrified and had no control. I didn’t have the tools or the leverage to do something different at the time.

Why is a naked girl body showcased here by a line art? And text on her arms and thighs that she is unique. And she is proud of herself. Why are we normalising perfect bodies? Why are we normalising thin Disney like waists, over fair skin and big eyes, slender neck and a sleek nose? Why do we judge people, here, girls, who are \"fat\" (finger quotes), who have a waist size over 40,who are \"dark\", have a big round nose and who wear clothes that she likes, and not the \"society\". And that is, a trend, a big BIG trend, for over so many years now. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING BODY SHAMING. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING SLUT SHAMING. WHY ARE WE NORMALISING IGNORANCE FOR GIRLS WHO STAND AGAINST THESE SHITS. I don\\'t know rest, but every second NORMAL girl goes through this. Body shaming. Slut shaming. In school. I was. Many I know were. And we didn\\'t say anything. I was dumb who stayed quiet all this time. I was dumb who thought it was good to ignore such ill minded people. Let them laugh over the size of my body, let them make fun of how I look. Let them speak shit about me every fucking time. I never said anything. I was dumb. I should have said that. But I didn\\'t and I regret that. Just because I didn\\'t say anything to those sexually shaming bullies then, that might ve made them say same or even worse about / to other girls I may or may not know. This...is something very near to a breakdown. This is something like...\"God,why?\" I heard them daily. Passing such cheap comments and I was always quiet about it. I hate myself for that. But now I am not. I am saying this on my public account. Yes, those animals can see it too, and can laugh it off by again calling me slut and what not.

For over a year has immersed herself in a terrifying and shocking world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women. In this ground-breaking investigation, Laura traces the roots of extreme misogyny across a complex network of online groups extending from Men's Rights Activists and Pick up Artists to Men Going their Own Way, Trolls and the Incel movement, in the name of which some men have committed terrorist acts. Seeing boys and men groomed and radicalised to adopt an extreme and misogynistic mindset, Laura has spent months drawing parallels with other extremist movements around the world, seeking to understand what attracts men and boys to the movement, how it operates and considers what can be done. Most urgently of all, Laura traces the pathways this extreme ideology has taken from the darkest corners of the internet to emerge covertly in our mainstream media, our playgrounds and even our parliament.

       " 'This week we are talking about women\\'s sexual health, as it is an important but very taboo part of women\\'s overall wellbeing. While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men, thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff, we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ As women, we seem to teeter in this fine line of \"if you\\'re not giving it up you\\'re a prude, but if you are you\\'re a slut\". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they\\'re too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health, we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image, and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let\\'s make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀',\n",

So yeah, our costume was short but that doesn\\'t justify all the sexual harassment we got here. I assure you I can tell the difference between complimenting vs harassing. (I mean, aren\\'t we all, ladies.) I tried to just ignore it, as we came to have fun and you know I am pretty understanding of drunk people. But that French guy saying \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?\" totally brought back my worst memories in as an exchange student. I am not tokenizing all guys, and that\\'s not the point of this posting. I want to say if you are an Asian girl traveling to countries with smaller Asian populations, prepare your own one liner. If you get harassed unexpectedly and do nothing, your brain will explode with thoughts like I should\\'ve said this, I should\\'ve said that. Although I am having fun, that moment is played over and over back of my brain, thinking what would\\'ve been the best reaction for them not to think they can do that to Asian women. So if you don\\'t want to ruin the whole trip because of some jerks, it\\'s good to prepare your own one liner for the worst case. And as a person who traveled to 24 countries and 56 cities in Europe, I can tell you, with a 99% chance you will thank me and yourself being prepared. My line is \"Get educated\" from now on. And with this posting, I will forget everything and enjoy the rest of my trip. 는 기대이하였다. 아니 전세계 술취한 사람 몇천명을 보는 게 재미없을 수가 없긴한데 그 술취한 남자들이 동양여자한테 향하는 시선이 불편했다. 물론 모든 남자를 다 싸잡아서 욕할 맘은 없고 이 글의 포인트도 아니다. 동양여자로서 유럽을 여행할 때는 자기만의 방어기제를 준비하라고 하는 말이다. 그렇지 않고 무방비한 상태에서 그런 일을 당하면 여행을 제대로 망칠 수 있다. 웃고 있어도, 뭘 마시고 뭘 먹어도 머리 한켠에서는 끊임없이 그 상황을 재현한다. \\'어떻게 했으면 내가 속이 시원했을까\\' \\'그들도 불편하게 했어야 앞으로 동양인 여자를 우습게 여기지 않을텐데\\' .. 이럼서 무한 반복. 특히 나같이 부당한 일에 부들부들 떠는 종족들은 이거 여행 끝날 때까지 간다. 유럽 여행할 때는 꼭 최악의 상황을 염두하고 자기만의 대처방식 하나씩은 준비해놓는 게 좋다. 그리고 유럽 24개국 56개 도시를 여행한 사람으로서 말하는데, 99% 당함. 준비하는게 좋음. 난 \"Get educated\" 라고 정했다. 아무리 병신이어도 에듀케이션이란 영어는 알겠지. 다시 깨닫고 돌아간다. 아 내가 이래서 10년간 유럽을 안왔지.',\n",

Both of their lives were dedicated to fighting for equal rights through any means necessary. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Although she had spearheaded of the movement, Rivera had to fight to speak during a 1973 pride rally because, as Melinda Chateauvert writes in her book Sex Workers Unite, “The crowd did not want to hear from a transgender sex worker.” Rivera & other sex workers joined Gay Liberation Front in an attempt to create a coalition of leftist queer folk.

       " 'The focus of this month for Jivamukti Yoga has been about silence through the exploration of this theme, at first I was thinking about how important it is that we take more time to be quiet, to be still, to say less. And then I thought about the flip side ~ when is silence... bad? There are times when we as individual people, community, society, or world are silent because we choose to stay comfortable than to speak for what’s right. Watching and reading about all these horrible stories of women (mostly but not exclusively) being abused - whether physically sexually or otherwise by trusted leaders, famous singers, and even teachers in the yoga community that we look up to - and the world being silent about it for so long makes me stop and wonder. Some of the atrocities were just well hidden, yet some we knew of but just stayed idle in the hope that it would come to light on its own. And if we feel voiceless and powerless can we then hope that those in power will say and do what’s right? I’m not so sure. We can only trust our own voice, and speak from a place of conviction with clarity and compassion. ️ Thoughts?!',\n",

Before this happened to me, of course I swore if my husband ever cheated on me. I would leave him. And of course I thought about it. Even tried. But I didn't go far. He promised to stop. The affair ended with her. The cheating continued the rest of our 17 yr marriage. Sometimes he hide it better than other times. It's amazing what men can get away with when they have money, control and power. People often assume that if a man is cheating on his wife it's because they are not getting any sex from their wife. That's not true. Not with men like this. My ex-husband and I had sex on a regular basis. I wasn't allowed to say no. It was my wifely duty. It was a unspoken rule between us. The first time I resisted was on our honeymoon. I learned that night. Sexual abuse occurs regularly as a part of domestic abuse, it's just rarely discussed. There is so much shame with each topic individual, nevermind together. No still means no. Anything other than yes means no.

She spent three days in prison, before being released on bail for six months. A week ago, in the courthouse, Khodyari overheard that she could face up to two years’ imprisonment for being seen in public without a hijab, and, as a result, she poured gasoline on herself, and set it alight. The ‘Blue Girl’ later died in hospital, after 90% of her body was left with third degree burns, and she suffered serious lung damage. The activist’s death has led to outcry and grief; her favourite club (Esteghlal) published a statement mourning her death, and held a one minute’s silence, while Philip Luther from Amnesty International declared the incident “heartbreaking”, explaining that the death highlighted the effect of Iran’s \"appalling contempt for women\\'s rights\". - Liz 🦎 . . . .',\n",

The idea that women are subordinate to men has been ingrained into society from the very start, and I’m beginning to understand why more and more. I’m currently reading Simone de Beauvoir’s ‘The Second Sex’, and, while I have a lot to criticise about her as a person, as well as her writing, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that woman’s ability to give birth somehow made them inferior. That was largely because they could not fight nor hunt, as pregnancy effectively rendered them useless, and, once the child was born, the mother had to care for it, while the father fought, defended, or scavenged for food. What these “primitives” failed to realise was that the strength childbirth requires is absolutely immense, and the concept that women were merely weak, offspring-producing machines with little else about them was one that remained for centuries. - Liz 🦎 . . .',\n",

If a fault is found in a woman’s leadership, it’s often described as typical of her gender. Yet, if she performs well, it’s thought of as an exception! There’s also a stigma around women exhibiting “Queen Bee” behaviour when they get to the top and “pulling the drawbridge up” for other women to succeed by turning down requests for advice and mentoring from junior women. The simple truth is that there’s fewer women at the top to help the many women lower down, and it’s simply not possible to help them all. Whilst helping other women may be a priority for lots of female leaders, we need to remember that they also have perform well at their own job – particularly given this greater scrutiny. . . .',\n",

       " 'Exactly one year ago today, Tuesday, October 16 at around 10:00pm, I was assaulted and raped in my apartment. The fear, shame, self-hatred, depression and suicidal thoughts that accompany such a thing are indescribable. It didn’t take long at all for me to reach the lowest point in my life. Too many nights, alone in the same apartment that the attack happened, I would find myself praying to God, asking Him to end my life, because I knew I couldn’t bring myself to do it, but I just couldn’t see any way to come back from such a thing. I. Hated. Me. Have you ever felt that way? I wanted to give up, but He wouldn’t let me. He blessed me with an incredible support system of friends and family who listened to me scream and cry and doubt and hope, all in the same breath. Two months later, I decided enough was enough. God had been taking me on a journey of learning how to love myself for the last two years, and I finally decided that instead of letting this rape consume my life and define me, I was going to learn from it. I was going to grow from it. I was going to thrive. Shaving off my hair was the easiest and best decision ever. I knew I had nothing left to lose, but so much to gain, from letting go of all of my insecurities and hangups, and letting God really teach me how to love myself. Today, I’m not perfect. There are days that I still look in the mirror and hate who and what I see. I’m still insecure. But I love myself more today than I did last year. I love myself more today than I did yesterday. And I know God is more than satisfied with that. ——— If you have ever gone through anything like this, ever had thoughts like this, or just need someone to talk to - I’m someone!

       " 'Shannon Maley had a seeming vendetta against a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities who was dating her sister. She barely knew him, yet claimed he sexually assaulted her and her friends. Maley then created multiple social media accounts under the young man’s name and sent herself disturbing and threatening messages in order to frame him. She has since pleaded guilty to “perverting the course of justice and also to harassing witnesses,” The Daily Record, a UK news publication reports. The young man, who will not be named by because he is the victim and will instead be referred to as John Doe, told the Record he was on the brink of suicide until he was acquitted last November on five charges of sexual assault. The outlet reported that he “sat on the ledge of his 14th-storey flat window seriously contemplating whether life was worth living because of the vicious lies that had ‘destroyed’ him.” Maley’s messages to herself included threats “to set you on fire and watch you burn alive” and claims that John was “not going to stop causing you pain.” Maley had apparently intimidated her friends into making accusations against John as well. One of those friends eventually admitted that the young man had not sexually assaulted her and that Maley had harassed her and tried to influence their testimony at John\\'s trial. John was also accused of sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls who were also allegedly friends of Maley. A witness explained that John didn’t do what he was accused of doing, leading to acquittal on those charges. Maley’s story unraveled after she accused John of sending a threatening message while he was in prison without access to the Internet. No reason has been given for Maley’s vendetta against John, and the young man still fears for his safety. \"It feels like Shannon Maley has destroyed my life. I still can’t walk down the street without people shouting abuse at me,” John said. “I’ve had voicemails from people I don’t even know saying they’re going to blow up my house. Unfortunately, people believe what they see online and it’s a very dangerous situation. She\\'s an absolute monster. I want to see her punished for ruining my life.\"',\n",

       " 'Stop calling me a nurse. Stop stereotyping on the basis of sex. Stop assuming the role of women in the workplace. Stop undermining my rights to have a career of my choice. Just stop. ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ Let me just tell you truthfully, there hasn’t been a single day in the last two weeks that I’ve been in the OR where I haven’t been called a “nurse”. The worse part is, when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident, the shock on their face is even more offensive. Don’t get me wrong, I would be honored to be a nurse, it’s one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so it’s not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a “doctor”, is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether you’re a doctor, PA, nurse, pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a difference: when you see discrimination, of any kind, say something and leave a lasting impression. Here’s what I mean, in dental school, I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled, and said “no I am a dentist” and then moved on. I didn’t feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel it’s on the basis of gender, I smile, say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isn’t to fight with everyone, it’s to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something. And guess what, everyone has a role to play whether you’re a man or woman.',\n",

People keep asking me how do I feel about all of this, ya know having my deep dark secrets out in full view? To be honest, as I am excited, I am equally terrified. There are topics in the book that I’ve never shared with the public. And especially as a Muslim woman, we are to remain pure in the public eye. We are to be covered and devout and quiet and non-sexual. We are never to taint what the world views as a perfect practicing Hijabi. We aren’t afforded mistakes. But men get “oh, boys will be boys” and 99 excuses for their fuckery. One of the topics I cover is sexuality and virginity. I won’t give anything away, but I was extremely uncomfortable writing some of these stories. I couldn’t get out of my head, that I’m going to hell for sharing these things as a Muslim woman. It has been etched into my head that Muslim women just don’t explore or talk about sexuality, among other things. We are to stay naive. Even now, I’m not sure how I will prepare myself for the onslaught of negativity that this topic in particular will get from the Muslim community. I can’t stress this enough, I’m not the poster child for Islam. Yes, I’m Muslim but I don’t speak for all Muslims. Nor are we one size fits all. Why do women have to play the pious virgin role in order to not be deemed as “that kind of girl”? Have you ever felt like if you go against a certain aspect of your religion or culture that you would “go to hell”?

The thirst is coming from the other person who is seeking to find something specific within that particular person right? They are thirsty for something.. Usually this saying is all around sex... However it could be deeper than that... which is usually always is... So let\\'s address the word.. \"trap\".... The way this is stated is that the woman who is embodying her sexuality, sexiness, sensuality, and confidence thru her physical expression is only doing so to attract someone to her.. or.... lure him to her web... (Exhibition or validation.. an episode I\\'m working on for the show) The evil sexually empowered woman... (Lilith running thru me) ... CAUSING the man to take his eyes away from his current partner (witch wound and the illusion of \"mine\" is an upcoming episode on Rising Goddess Radio).. taking something from another and trapping it in her web of sexual prowess.... Slut.. Whore.. Skank.. Bitch.. 🤔 ... interesting... So ultimately calling someone a \"thirst trap\" is another form of slut shaming, because you (proverbial you who is calling people this based off their choices of sexually empowered photos) are seeing something within them that triggers fear of loss.. OR... if you are the person who is \"thirsty\"... calling this person who is trapping you with their thirst, the problem, and ultimately not having to take responsibility for the triggered emotions and thought processes and actions coming from that trigger.... 🤔 ... interesting...

Sometimes I feel absolutely invisible only up and to the point of objectification. Censorship takes a toll on your psych, on your physical wellbeing. As sex workers we are constantly excluded from conversations about our work and as human beings we are othered and aliened from general “society.” . . Even as said society worships our ideals, I find myself exhausted and run down more than I care to admit. Shame, stigma, fear, violence all of the destructive and abusive interactions can be boiled down to the fact that we do not allow ourselves to have a nuanced perspective on our own sexuality. We project! We Attack those we wish to emulate! I can’t even count how many times I was taught and did enforce sexism and self censorship myself in my younger days. . . My sexuality and my body (nude or not) gives me strength, and power, and people seek out my time to bask in that energy. Constantly making me censor my own body only reminds me of how dangerous the world see’s me. This fear allows them to take away our rights and demonize our actions while they continue to see us in private.

It was at that time that I witnessed a peek into Lindy's world. She had just returned to Seattle from being invited to participate in a nationally televised debate on the matter. A debate that resulted instantly in rape, violence and death threats from faceless commenters. I will never forget how raw and resolute she was as she read them aloud to us that night.

A good starting point can be analysing your CV, although you need to go beyond this to articulate your potential.

If you do not (at least) appear to have confidence in what you say, do, suggest or recommend, why should anyone else? Our 2019 survey results found that whilst 81.1% of women felt that always or mostly demonstrated external confidence, only 47% matched this with strong internal confidence. Whilst it’s brilliant that women are resilient enough to present a confident façade, some of their potential will undoubtably be lost due to this lack of self-belief. To change things we have to address the cause, not the symptoms. These internal confidence issues are caused by external biases which eclipse the truth about individual women’s capability potential. By using psychological insights, we want to expose these limiting beliefs and enable all women to unlock their full potential. Is your internal confidence holding you back? . . .',\n",

For some survivors telling their story is a radical act of healing if their reality has been denied or they have been conditioned to protect the feelings of another at the expense of there own. Survivors own their stories and with that they have the right to choose to withhold or share them The unfortunate truth is that most people who do come forward are subjected to further feelings of shame by being dismissed, their motives, actions questioned and worried that our untold stories will invite disapproval and victim blaming/shaming. Regardless of how our stories differ, our experiences are our own, we have all endures something that never should have happened to us, this is the connection we share.

       " 'I’m with you. ・・・ Natasha // Upstate NY | I’ve thought a lot about whether of not to post this story, but, I think it’s important. So, fuck it. Here’s the story Natasha’s Photo. Natasha is my Godsister. I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field, listening to music, shooting, talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world, not performing for any “gaze,” but rather, celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned, and then outraged, especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own, but naked women posing for men are fine, but this image, this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful, unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. It’s been that way ever since. Now, I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I don’t particularly care. However, Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not, as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions. So, I’m calling you out Instagram. I’m not the only one you’ve buried. And I’m tired of you telling me what I want to see in my timeline, because your algorithm sucks. If I follow someone, I want to see their images, not the same 5 people and nobody else. Show me my damn friends and stop making women feel like only images a frat boy would wanna jerk off to is what the beauty standard of a woman should be.',\n",

Why is a naked girl body showcased here by a line art? And text on her arms and thighs that she is unique. And she is proud of herself. Why are we normalising perfect bodies? Why are we normalising thin Disney like waists, over fair skin and big eyes, slender neck and a sleek nose? Why do we judge people, here, girls, who are \"fat\" (finger quotes), who have a waist size over 40,who are \"dark\", have a big round nose and who wear clothes that she likes, and not the \"society\".

WHY ARE WE NORMALISING IGNORANCE FOR GIRLS WHO STAND AGAINST THESE SHITS. I don\\'t know rest, but every second NORMAL girl goes through this. Body shaming. Slut shaming. In school. I was.

For over a year has immersed herself in a terrifying and shocking world of violence and hatred that is actively and directly causing mass murders of women. In this ground-breaking investigation, Laura traces the roots of extreme misogyny across a complex network of online groups extending from Men's Rights Activists and Pick up Artists to Men Going their Own Way, Trolls and the Incel movement, in the name of which some men have committed terrorist acts. Seeing boys and men groomed and radicalised to adopt an extreme and misogynistic mindset, Laura has spent months drawing parallels with other extremist movements around the world, seeking to understand what attracts men and boys to the movement, how it operates and considers what can be done. Most urgently of all, Laura traces the pathways this extreme ideology has taken from the darkest corners of the internet to emerge covertly in our mainstream media, our playgrounds and even our parliament.

       " 'This week we are talking about women\\'s sexual health, as it is an important but very taboo part of women\\'s overall wellbeing. While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men, thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff, we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming.     As women, we seem to teeter in this fine line of \"if you\\'re not giving it up you\\'re a prude, but if you are you\\'re a slut\". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they\\'re too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health, we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image, and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let\\'s make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.   ',\n",

       " '[ - ] The tragedy started when I bought costume in the US. If you google you can find.. . So yeah, our costume was short but that doesn\\'t justify all the sexual harassment we got here. I assure you I can tell the difference between complimenting vs harassing. (I mean, aren\\'t we all, ladies.) I tried to just ignore it, as we came to have fun and you know I am pretty understanding of drunk people. But that French guy saying \"Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?\" totally brought back my worst memories in as an exchange student. I am not tokenizing all guys, and that\\'s not the point of this posting. I want to say if you are an Asian girl traveling to countries with smaller Asian populations, prepare your own one liner. If you get harassed unexpectedly and do nothing, your brain will explode with thoughts like I should\\'ve said this, I should\\'ve said that. Although I am having fun, that moment is played over and over back of my brain, thinking what would\\'ve been the best reaction for them not to think they can do that to Asian women. So if you don\\'t want to ruin the whole trip because of some jerks, it\\'s good to prepare your own one liner for the worst case. And as a person who traveled to 24 countries and 56 cities in Europe, I can tell you, with a 99% chance you will thank me and yourself being prepared. My line is \"Get educated\" from now on.

What is often left out of this narrative is that it was spearheaded by two transgender sex workers of colorMarsha P. Johnson & Sylvia Rivera. According to the Global Network of Sex Work Projects (NSWP), the Stonewall Inn was commonly raided by the police because it was a notorious hangout for sex workers, trans people of color & other marginalized people.  Following the riot, Johnson & Rivera co-founded the organization Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries, a group dedicated to helping homeless young drag queens & trans women of color. Both of their lives were dedicated to fighting for equal rights through any means necessary.  Although she had spearheaded of the movement, Rivera had to fight to speak during a 1973 pride rally because, as Melinda Chateauvert writes in her book Sex Workers Unite, The crowd did not want to hear from a transgender sex worker. Rivera & other sex workers joined Gay Liberation Front in an attempt to create a coalition of leftist queer folk. GLF fought for the sexual revolution & an anti-capitalist agenda to combat violence & discrimination against the LGBTQ community.  In Prostitution Papers, Kate Millet writes Prostitution, homosexuality & abortion are 3 instances where the law infringed upon sexual freedom. Bringing issues together to form umbrella groups for activism is often essential in creating the space for change, as well-known trans activist wrote in her book Outspoken Full article by  launched the Sex Worker Giving Circle with the dual goal of funding a diverse range of sex worker-led groups throughout the country & bringing current & former sex workers to the philanthropic decision-making table.

       " 'The focus of this month for Jivamukti Yoga has been about silence through the exploration of this theme, at first I was thinking about how important it is that we take more time to be quiet, to be still, to say less. And then I thought about the flip side ~ when is silence... bad? There are times when we as individual people, community, society, or world are silent because we choose to stay comfortable than to speak for whats right. Watching and reading about all these horrible stories of women (mostly but not exclusively) being abused - whether physically sexually or otherwise by trusted leaders, famous singers, and even teachers in the yoga community that we look up to - and the world being silent about it for so long makes me stop and wonder. Some of the atrocities were just well hidden, yet some we knew of but just stayed idle in the hope that it would come to light on its own. And if we feel voiceless and powerless can we then hope that those in power will say and do whats right? Im not so sure. We can only trust our own voice, and speak from a place of conviction with clarity and compassion.  Thoughts?!',\n",

Before this happened to me, of course I swore if my husband ever cheated on me. I would leave him. And of course I thought about it. Even tried. But I didn't go far. He promised to stop. The affair ended with her. The cheating continued the rest of our 17 yr marriage. Sometimes he hide it better than other times. It's amazing what men can get away with when they have money, control and power. People often assume that if a man is cheating on his wife it's because they are not getting any sex from their wife. That's not true. Not with men like this. My ex-husband and I had sex on a regular basis. I wasn't allowed to say no. It was my wifely duty. It was a unspoken rule between us. The first time I resisted was on our honeymoon. I learned that night. Sexual abuse occurs regularly as a part of domestic abuse, it's just rarely discussed. There is so much shame with each topic individual, nevermind together. No still means no. Anything other than yes means no. Because it's not always possible to say no but it's damn obvious that you're not saying yes. That's sexual abuse. Which is domestic abuse.

The idea that women are subordinate to men has been ingrained into society from the very start, and Im beginning to understand why more and more. Im currently reading Simone de Beauvoirs The Second Sex, and, while I have a lot to criticise about her as a person, as well as her writing, its becoming increasingly obvious that womans ability to give birth somehow made them inferior. That was largely because they could not fight nor hunt, as pregnancy effectively rendered them useless, and, once the child was born, the mother had to care for it, while the father fought, defended, or scavenged for food. What these primitives failed to realise was that the strength childbirth requires is absolutely immense, and the concept that women were merely weak, offspring-producing machines with little else about them was one that remained for centuries. - Liz . . .',\n",

Theres also a stigma around women exhibiting Queen Bee behaviour when they get to the top and pulling the drawbridge up for other women to succeed by turning down requests for advice and mentoring from junior women. The simple truth is that theres fewer women at the top to help the many women lower down, and its simply not possible to help them all.

The fear, shame, self-hatred, depression and suicidal thoughts that accompany such a thing are indescribable. It didnt take long at all for me to reach the lowest point in my life. Too many nights, alone in the same apartment that the attack happened, I would find myself praying to God, asking Him to end my life, because I knew I couldnt bring myself to do it, but I just couldnt see any way to come back from such a thing. I. Hated. Me. Have you ever felt that way? I wanted to give up, but He wouldnt let me. He blessed me with an incredible support system of friends and family who listened to me scream and cry and doubt and hope, all in the same breath. Two months later, I decided enough was enough. God had been taking me on a journey of learning how to love myself for the last two years, and I finally decided that instead of letting this rape consume my life and define me, I was going to learn from it. I was going to grow from it. I was going to thrive. Shaving off my hair was the easiest and best decision ever. I knew I had nothing left to lose, but so much to gain, from letting go of all of my insecurities and hangups, and letting God really teach me how to love myself. Today, Im not perfect. There are days that I still look in the mirror and hate who and what I see. Im still insecure. But I love myself more today than I did last year. I love myself more today than I did yesterday. And I know God is more than satisfied with that.  If you have ever gone through anything like this, ever had thoughts like this, or just need someone to talk to - Im someone!

       " 'Shannon Maley had a seeming vendetta against a 20-year-old man with learning disabilities who was dating her sister. She barely knew him, yet claimed he sexually assaulted her and her friends. Maley then created multiple social media accounts under the young mans name and sent herself disturbing and threatening messages in order to frame him. She has since pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice and also to harassing witnesses, The Daily Record, a UK news publication reports. The young man, who will not be named by because he is the victim and will instead be referred to as John Doe, told the Record he was on the brink of suicide until he was acquitted last November on five charges of sexual assault. The outlet reported that he sat on the ledge of his 14th-storey flat window seriously contemplating whether life was worth living because of the vicious lies that had destroyed him. Maleys messages to herself included threats to set you on fire and watch you burn alive and claims that John was not going to stop causing you pain. Maley had apparently intimidated her friends into making accusations against John as well. One of those friends eventually admitted that the young man had not sexually assaulted her and that Maley had harassed her and tried to influence their testimony at John\\'s trial. John was also accused of sexually assaulting two 15-year-old girls who were also allegedly friends of Maley. A witness explained that John didnt do what he was accused of doing, leading to acquittal on those charges. Maleys story unraveled after she accused John of sending a threatening message while he was in prison without access to the Internet. No reason has been given for Maleys vendetta against John, and the young man still fears for his safety. \"It feels like Shannon Maley has destroyed my life. I still cant walk down the street without people shouting abuse at me, John said. Ive had voicemails from people I dont even know saying theyre going to blow up my house. Unfortunately, people believe what they see online and its a very dangerous situation. She\\'s an absolute monster. I want to see her punished for ruining my life.\"',\n",

Let me just tell you truthfully, there hasnt been a single day in the last two weeks that Ive been in the OR where I havent been called a nurse. The worse part is, when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident, the shock on their face is even more offensive. Dont get me wrong, I would be honored to be a nurse, its one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so its not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a doctor, is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether youre a doctor, PA, nurse, pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a when you see discrimination, of any kind, say something and leave a lasting impression. Heres what I mean, in dental school, I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled, and said no I am a dentist and then moved on. I didnt feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel its on the basis of gender, I smile, say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isnt to fight with everyone, its to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something.

There are topics in the book that Ive never shared with the public. And especially as a Muslim woman, we are to remain pure in the public eye. We are to be covered and devout and quiet and non-sexual. We are never to taint what the world views as a perfect practicing Hijabi. We arent afforded mistakes. But men get oh, boys will be boys and 99 excuses for their fuckery. One of the topics I cover is sexuality and virginity. I wont give anything away, but I was extremely uncomfortable writing some of these stories. I couldnt get out of my head, that Im going to hell for sharing these things as a Muslim woman. It has been etched into my head that Muslim women just dont explore or talk about sexuality, among other things. We are to stay naive. Even now, Im not sure how I will prepare myself for the onslaught of negativity that this topic in particular will get from the Muslim community. I cant stress this enough, Im not the poster child for Islam. Yes, Im Muslim but I dont speak for all Muslims. Nor are we one size fits all. Why do women have to play the pious virgin role in order to not be deemed as that kind of girl? Have you ever felt like if you go against a certain aspect of your religion or culture that you would go to hell? All religions (or non) can chime in. *Also, the winners of the book giveaway are  DM meeeee!',\n",

The sense of sadness, hopelessness and disgust they bring you. The kind that makes you want to go out and do something about the way society and politics work. You get all excited for some time but in the end you boil down to a realisation that if you go too deep and too honest, you might end up dead, just like Lankesh, Vemula and other unsung martyrs. So you calm the fuck down and let things be. I've been this person at times, at times not. I keep trying to muster up enough courage and speak up for things.

Either way, as someone who experienced sexual trauma and had to personally deal with the guilt and pain that comes with it YEARS after, I realize now that I dont need to give two shits anymore lol.

The thirst is coming from the other person who is seeking to find something specific within that particular person right? They are thirsty for something.. Usually this saying is all around sex... However it could be deeper than that... which is usually always is... So let\\'s address the word.. \"trap\".... The way this is stated is that the woman who is embodying her sexuality, sexiness, sensuality, and confidence thru her physical expression is only doing so to attract someone to her.. or.... lure him to her web... (Exhibition or validation.. an episode I\\'m working on for the show) The evil sexually empowered woman... (Lilith running thru me) ... CAUSING the man to take his eyes away from his current partner (witch wound and the illusion of \"mine\" is an upcoming episode on Rising Goddess Radio).. taking something from another and trapping it in her web of sexual prowess.... Slut.. Whore.. Skank.. Bitch.. ... interesting... So ultimately calling someone a \"thirst trap\" is another form of slut shaming, because you (proverbial you who is calling people this based off their choices of sexually empowered photos) are seeing something within them that triggers fear of loss.. OR... if you are the person who is \"thirsty\"... calling this person who is trapping you with their thirst, the problem, and ultimately not having to take responsibility for the triggered emotions and thought processes and actions coming from that trigger.... ... interesting...

Lindy was a fresh and unrelenting voice for womens issues. Her public denouncing of rape as comedic subject matter elevated her name into the national arena, if she liked it or not. It was at that time that I witnessed a peek into Lindy's world. She had just returned to Seattle from being invited to participate in a nationally televised debate on the matter. A debate that resulted instantly in rape, violence and death threats from faceless commenters. I will never forget how raw and resolute she was as she read them aloud to us that night. In that moment, I saw a Joan of Arch-type heroine in Lindy. I was so enamored with her strength and inspired by her defiance to be silenced. When told I was to photograph her for the magazine, this concept came naturally.\",\n",

If you do not (at least) appear to have confidence in what you say, do, suggest or recommend, why should anyone else? Our 2019 survey results found that whilst 81.1% of women felt that always or mostly demonstrated external confidence, only 47% matched this with strong internal confidence. Whilst its brilliant that women are resilient enough to present a confident faade, some of their potential will undoubtably be lost due to this lack of self-belief. To change things we have to address the cause, not the symptoms. These internal confidence issues are caused by external biases which eclipse the truth about individual womens capability potential.

Natasha is my Godsister. I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field, listening to music, shooting, talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world, not performing for any gaze, but rather, celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned, and then outraged, especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own, but naked women posing for men are fine, but this image, this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful, unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. Its been that way ever since. Now, I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I dont particularly care. However, Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not, as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions. So, Im calling you out Instagram. Im not the only one youve buried. And Im tired of you telling me what I want to see in my timeline, because your algorithm sucks.
