In my best \"wife to be\" impression I said \"no, of course\".

Well, by 8pm Baby Handmade had been sick over his cot, choked on phlegm, cried his eyes out and would only settle on Mummy in Mummy\\'s bed. So I laid there on the bed. In the dark. Dying for a drink and feeling like my bladder was having a rave up of it\\'s own until he finally drifted off to sleep about 2 hours later. \\nThen I went on Facebook. 😂\\n\\nThere must have been a lot of extra time on the football thing because Mr didn\\'t come home until 1am 🕙.

Whilst the marriage started out rosey, Henry started bonking around and got all \"aggy\" that Cazza wasn\\'t giving him a son. Then Anne \"Might have Introduced the Blowjob to England\" Boleyn came on the scene. Cazza, devoutly Catholic, swore blind she hadn\\'t bonked Arthur so Henners had no reason to divorce her... Bible Drama. The Pope refused the divorce, so Henners, determined to get into Anne\\'s knickers, broke with the Roman Catholic Church and set up his own religion.... The Psychotic Bastard Religion as @eddieizzard calls it. Actually called The Church of England. He Married Anne, cut her head off and started marrying everyone he met. Cazza was relegated to Dowager Princess of Wales and died alone in 1536. When Henry, her ex, found out he threw a party. Nice.

We discussed in vivid detail (together and with our videographer) how we wanted the scene portrayed. It started by me walking out of a store to see a man waiting outside, but watching me. This is normal everyday life. But his body language portrayed differently. His arms lowered when we made eye contact and he quickly looked away. I continued walking and then noticed he discarded something from his hands and turned my direction. These are all signs. We had a few suggestions that later in the video when I notice he is following me into the parking lot that I should run or show a scared expression on my face. But I disagreed. Why? Because I'm tired of videos showing women helpless and scared. And although this specific scenario was being acted out, this has happened to me before. I had a man follow me out to my car one time. I was able to avoid anything happening because I had a plan. Was it scary? Yes. Was I shaking? Yes. But I was in control and a potentially dangerous situation was avoided. And that's what I want our material to teach others how to do too. 》 How to recognize signs. 》 How to coordinate a plan in a matter of seconds. 》 How to be in control.

In these conversations, Rosselló is found to have been homophobic, racist, misogynistic and simply arrogant. Through these conversations he verbally attacked victims of recent tragedies like hurricane Maria as well as multiple mainstream Boricuan personalities including Ricky Martin who went on to lead one of the 5 day protests in San Juan, Puerto Rico. In Bad Bunny and Residente’s words “Si todo el pueblo quiere que te vayas y tú te quedas, entonces estamos en dictadura” (If the entire town wants you to leave and you stay, we’re in a dictatorship). Importantly, the people have demanded that he leaves and despite many of his associates having resigned, he refuses to leave as part of his intolerance and arrogance.

I am one of those people who has been sexually violated, and when I was younger, I can say that I was not as respectful of the boundaries of others as I should have been. I am also one of those people who doesn\\'t mind most physical contact. Outside of the times that I was sexually violated or have had my butt pinched, I can think of only one time that anyone touched me when it really bothered me and that was very innocent. A guy told me \"thank you\" for something I had done for him and put his hand briefly between my shoulders. I don\\'t know why it bothered me, but it felt like the devil had run through my body. Had he kept his hand there, I probably would have asked him to stop, and he probably would have respected that. Being able to ask for your boundaries to be respected, and having them respected is an extremely important thing. One of the things the movement is bringing to the forefront of discussion is the importance of having one\\'s boundaries honored and respected. No matter who someone is, no matter how much authority or influence they may have, they have no right to touch you in a way that you are not willing to allow. The only exception might be an effort to subdue someone who is resisting arrest, being violent or in process of violating someone. This whole discussion about physical boundaries is one that society needs to continue. It is about time it was brought out of the shadows and into the open light of scrutiny. Our bodies are the one possession within our absolute domain. Our comfort or lack of comfort with being touched is our own business and whatever boundaries we set need to be respected. Even those who violate others would not want certain touch from certian people. The Golden Rule can therefore be applied in reverse. Do not do to others what you would not want done to you.',\n",

I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field, listening to music, shooting, talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world, not performing for any “gaze,” but rather, celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned, and then outraged, especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own, but naked women posing for men are fine, but this image, this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful, unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. It’s been that way ever since. Now, I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I don’t particularly care. However, Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not, as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions. So, I’m calling you out Instagram. I’m not the only one you’ve buried. And I’m tired of you telling me what I want to see in my timeline, because your algorithm sucks. If I follow someone, I want to see their images, not the same 5 people and nobody else. Show me my damn friends and stop making women feel like only images a frat boy would wanna jerk off to is what the beauty standard of a woman should be.',\n",

       " 'In February 1970, Kathleen Cleaver, communication secretary of the Black Panther Party (BPP), was asked by a reporter from the “women’s page” of the Washington Post what she thought was a woman’s role in the revolution. She responded, in part: “No one ever asks what a man’s place in the Revolution is.”1 To many, the BPP conjures up a hypermasculine image of Black men in leather coats and berets carrying shotguns. Yet at its height—according to a survey conducted by Chairman Bobby Seale in 1969—the party membership was over 60 percent female.2 These women were integral to every aspect of party life, including serving as prominent leaders. Yet until recently, much of their work has been sidelined in historical research and popular media. Recent scholarship is shedding light on the role of women in the BPP and the Black struggle more broadly. For activists involved in today’s struggles—from women who have been at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement, to the widespread impact and identification with (which among other things has prompted a reckoning with sexism within activist spaces), to the popular use of the term “intersectionality” to make sense of the interlocking forces of racial, class, and gendered oppression—the experience of women in the BPP offers a host of lessons. The BPP emerged in an era of global mass revolt. In the United States, the struggle against anti-Black racism was the central flashpoint that opened up a mass radicalization around a whole host of issues––from war and imperialism, to women’s and LGBT oppression, to class inequality and capitalism. By the end of the 1960s, millions of young Americans believed a revolution was necessary in this country and thousands flooded into revolutionary groups like the BPP. The BPP’s Ten Point Program outlined a vision for liberation, encompassing demands for jobs, housing, education, and self-determination. In its early phase, the party’s activity focused on “point 7”: the fight against police brutality. Making use of their Constitutional rights, the Panthers boldly asserted their intention to use arms to defend the Black community from police violence.',\n",

       " '“Slut-shaming”. What a really interesting word. Personally, I’m a user of this term, and I’m against slut-shaming. I’m against people shaming someone because they do things that apparently a slut would do – wearing “heavy” makeup, wearing a dress of a particular length, etc, etc.., Also when people shame rape victims for the time/place/existence of theirs, I tell them to not slut-shame them. “Stop slut-shaming women” is something I’ve advocated for a lot. I tell people not to slut-shame someone, because a slut is a bad thing to be – that’s what I’ve been meaning. Well, that’s what the usage means – it’s a derogatory, bad term. But I think I need to present forth why this caught my curiosity and got me into thinking: A slut is someone who has sexual relationships with many men. Also, someone like a prostitute. Dictionary defines “slut” as a woman who has many casual sexual partners, a sexually promiscuous person. Also surely, the term slut doesn’t refer to a woman who is a rapist. In wokeness, having sex is not bad. Being sexually promiscuous though, is unhealthy, but that’s a lot complicated too, and we’re not talking about that. But the whole idea of asking people to stop shaming a girl as a “slut”, because the word is derogatory – is it derogatory because sex is immoral? Is it derogatory because it is a WOMAN who is sexually promiscuous, and thus immoral? Is it derogatory because being a prostitute is... “bad”? (Which we aren’t talking about now either, for there’s so much complications when it comes to prostitution.) If having casual sex is bad/derogatory, why is there no such thing as a “slut-shaming a man”? There is no equivalent term for “slut” for a sexually promiscuous man as far as I know. I’m not comparing men and women, nor am I saying that thereby men should be slut-shamed. But I’m pointing out how this simply points out to the idea of sexual oppression and control we have. Do I mean that it’s simply okay for someone to shame someone as a “slut” and I don’t have to mind about it? No. But I’m talking about WHAT makes someone a “slut”, who is a “slut”, how people treat a “slut” and why we SHAME a “slut”. .',\n",

In terms of content, Father’s Day cards emphasized supporting the family economically, imparting practical lessons, and being the best—far more “Number One Dad” or “Best Dad Ever” sort of cards than mothers had. “It was like they needed an award, but there wasn’t a lot of depth in what they were achieving,” says Auster-Gussman, a doctoral candidate in social psychology at the University of Minnesota.

Whether or not you yourself are non-monogamous or curious about it, you are likely to encounter someone in your community who is, and this is a great book to help understand different avenues for creating relationship and empathy for those friends. For some, non-monogamy is considered a choice and for others it may be a deeper part of their personality. There is no 'better' or 'more enlightened' way to organize your relationship(s). There is, however, the reality that we live in a monogamous oriented society where most of us have not had as many, if any, solid examples of nonmonogamy. Also, slut shaming is still very much a part of the culture that we are collectively and intentionally replacing. Slut shaming is just one example of how we are subconsciously, or more overtly, coerced into monogamous lifestyles without free choice. One of my biggest take always from this book is how they gently break down all the ways we may try and coerce a relationship to be a certain way. The difficult conversations that include our fears, jealousy, judgements, anger, and insecurities of all sorts are so easily bypassed because they truly are difficult. Practicing these conversations and giving yourself space to explore these uncomfortable spaces is necessary for fulfilling relationships regardless of monogamy or nonmonogamy.

       " 'The following is an abridged excerpt from Christina Hoff Sommers\\' brilliant book, The War Against Boys: Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the school holiday for girls introduced by the Ms. Foundation for Women, is now in its ninth year. For the first few years, it was a girls-only event. For their part, the Ms. organizers remain adamantly opposed to including boys. In 1996, Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, began working with some feminist men\\'s groups to design a separate holiday for boys. If boys had their own day, the pressure would be off. The first Son\\'s Day was planned for Sunday, October 20, 1996. October was especially desirable because, as the Ms. planners pointed out, \"October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, so there will be lots of activities scheduled.\" Here are some of the ways \"Son\\'s Day\" was to be celebrated: Take your son—or \\'son for a day\\'—to an event that focuses on ending men\\'s violence against women. Call the Family Violence Prevention Fund at 800-END-ABUSE for information. Plan a game or sport in which the contest specifically does not keep score or declare a winner. Invite the community to watch and celebrate boys playing on teams for the sheer joy of playing. Since Son\\'s Day is on Sunday, make sure your son is involved in preparing the family for the work and school week ahead. This means: helping lay out clothes for siblings and making lunches. For boys not exhausted by all the fun and excitement of the day\\'s activities, the Ms. planners had a suggestion for the evening: Take your son grocery shopping then help him plan and prepare the family\\'s evening meal on Son\\'s Day. As the Ms. staff had planned it, Son\\'s Day would not even give the boys a day off from school. ====== Continue the book here: ____________________________________________',\n",

       " 'When I was 14 ,my high school English teacher Mr Rogers used to make me stand in the corner. When I would refuse, he would step towards me while I was seated at my desk, stand over me , sometimes with an erect penis and demand that I comply with his obscene and obviously sexually motivated punishments. During parent teacher conference, my Mom was shocked as Mr Rogers said I had a behavior problem and he claimed I was not ‘college bound’ because if It. My Mom knew better as I had a box of academic awards and never had a teacher claim I was disruptive. After the conference she asked me if he did anything inappropriate , as she was creeped out by how often Mr Rogers used the word ‘discipline’ during the meeting. I was so embarrassed that I allowed him to do this weird sexual stuff to me instead of finding the courage to walk out of class, that I told my Mom nothing happened, thus allowing him to do this to me for the rest of the semester. One time I even started my period while he was making me stand in the corner and he refused to let me go to the rest room. Sometimes boys in the class would make comments about girls bodies while we were standing in the corner (not their fault, they were kids too). It was HELLISH The police department stated that even if 100 former students witnessed Mr Rogers get an erection, that it’s not a prosecutable crime. As a former educator and child and family services contractor, I know what men like him are capable of. his actions are indicative of sexual deviancy. I’ve had an easy time reporting things that have happened to me as an adult, but the district did not make this easy. They first accused me of not complying with the investigation because I did not want to sit down with Mr Rogers at the school he abused me at and sat on my complaint for over a month because the Director of HR wanted to wait until ‘summer is over’. inschools',\n",

I am a happier person now, the happiest I have ever been in my life actually. No more self-blaming, done with feeling victimised, and embracing that I have survived through all that so that I can be the change the society needs. This is what I have to say now: My hymen doesn’t define my womanhood. My virginity shouldn’t be a tick-off for marriage proposals. I am more than just a sexual being. My choice of lifestyle, my choice of clothing and my existence is not a reason for anyone to sexually abuse me. I will not be blamed for how the society has raised men to see women as sexual tools before anything else. It wasn’t my fault and it never will be. I didn’t ask for it when I was 5 years old, when I was 14, 19 or 22 years old. But I lived with the guilt because I was afraid of the society. I was afraid of the shame I would bring to my family because of what adult men did to me and I am done with it! I still struggle with anxiety, there are still trigger points that gets to me. I stopped running from them, instead now I just find ways to overcome them. I make conscious choices to not allow those men to be within my life and surrounding. I made my stand because in the end, whether I like it or not, they are my demons to battle and I am ready to fight my grounds. I hope survivors who read this find strength within them to live through their life and find happiness in them. I hope the rest of you play a role to be a better human in this world.

Is men\\'s sexual wellbeing grossly misunderstood and considered secondary to women\\'s?

We saw Weinstein’s behaviour finally catching up with him, sparking the movement which made a point of saying enough is enough. It’s time to get real and stand up against anything that’s not! It was a HUGE shift and now I don’t think we can go back to skeletons in closets and fakery being accepted and embraced. And for the majority of people, I don’t think we’d want to anyway. I know I personally can’t keep silent about the things that matter. I can’t do the ‘let sleeping dogs lie’ or ‘be the bigger person,’ in the hope that other people’s karma delivers itself, or to prevent any flack on my own side. When I see injustice it eats away at me and I feel angry. There’s a difference between staying in your own lane and not speaking up when something’s not right. Especially about people who are out there expressing that they’ve done/are doing the work, when they haven’t/aren’t and are selling themselves as healers or helpers to others. To me, that’s next level shameful. Yes, we’re all a work in progress, but when you create a false narrative about yourself, denying the parts of you that you have yet to master or heal, you not only limit your own growth, but that of those around you. Lord knows I reveal my broken bits to you and everyone all the time. There’s no shame in their existence and there’s no shame in not being ready to discuss them, but there is in denying they exist. Because that’s not honest. That’s not real. That’s just another lie waiting to be exposed further down the line. And as they say, you’re only as sick as your secrets. So please understand, that I won’t keep yours. Because, if it can be killed by the truth...it deserves to be.',\n",

       " 'For your viewing pleasures... These are the final 3 installments of gallery artist ‘s project for “I have been working on this project with MoMA going through their archive and their collection. I’m going to be releasing new short videos every few weeks from this series. I wanted to think about the meaning and position of all of MoMA’s beautiful things in our time of image saturation and overwhelming choice. My project is loosely inspired by John Berger’s seminal 1970s video series Ways of Seeing, updated for our time. Berger’s project was a series of four 30-minute videos made for the BBC in 1972 as a reaction to the ways that television and new forms of commodity advertising were using art historical strategies in order to seduce consumers. His work critiqued the ways that images are used by those in power to make their interests seem inevitable or natural, and he demonstrates these power dynamics by looking at advertising, historical painting, and television. In my own project, I am similarly exploring how values and social norms are constructed and reinforced through art historical objects and popular images. The videos connect the power of art history and advertising to new issues around social media, contemporary feminism and the movement, technology and the intensified life of images, and news media and truth in the current moment. I wanted to think about the meaning and position of all of MoMA’s beautiful things in our time of image saturation and overwhelming choice.”',\n",

       " 'I \"experted\" for Annakeara Stinson\\'s piece on toxic masculinity, a term which in my view is often assumed to refer to the most debased of actions like rape, sexual harassment, violence, aggression, and which sometimes includes the \"boys will be boys\" explanation for a whole range of behaviors. But the way I see it, so often it is our more subtle everyday actions and beliefs that underpin this toxic system and which we need to consider. These are things like the view that women are just better care givers than men, or that men are less emotional than women, or that it would be weird for a woman to pay on a date with a man, since that is how women know men are interested, and then there is common defense of chivalry as a cherished tradition by caring men who just want to protect women. These are forms of benevolent sexism and they uphold a deeply entrenched system that divides behaviors and characteristics into male and female and then punishes anyone who strays from this binary script. So while many people are comfortable addressing the more obvious forms of toxicity, since so much benevolent sexism is presented as complimentary to women and is often supported by them, it is a lot harder to critique without being seen as petty or reactionary. But defaulting to this view is a slippery slope that then allows us to support increasingly hostile actions and makes us less likely to fight against gender based injustice overall. So I talk about that here. Link in bio.',\n",

I am scrolling, trying to figure out what gems I wanna drop today and notice that he is with a thin Black woman with very long braids, folding clothes together. They don’t speak as they fold. I guess his partner left, because when I look up, he is in front of me. He tells me that he wants to apologize to me. Immediately, I sit straight and become on guard. Automatically, I thought he was video taping me secretly. I ask him what’s there to be sorry about and that he was making me nervous. He says, “I know this is probably weird, but I just need to confess: I’ve been going through a lot, especially with my girl. I’m in a committed relationship though. And, I just wanna say you are very beautiful. But, when you walked in, I looked at your body and started having bad thoughts. I know you get this a lot and I just wanted to say that I was sorry for that.” Because I am nervous, taken aback, I tell him that I’ve been objectified by men, some to the point of assault. My ass has been slapped. Thighs caressed. One man tried to touch my vagina through my jeans. I am wearing a dingy Lilo & Stich tee and sweat pants today. I’ve worn dresses. Been fully clothed and still called slut because of my body shape. It always seems to be the woman who is always at fault for how men perceive her body. I’m a bit shaken up.

'Someone who sleeps with anyone and everyone', 'someone who just looks slutty', 'someone who's got loads of kids by loads of different men', 'someone who works in the sex industry'. My usual response is 'hmmm ok then', but lately I've started to respond a bit differently. What is it to you if a lady decides to sleep with 1 man or 10,000 men? Who gave you the right to label her? If she's happy, safe and not hurting anybody, then what business is it of yours? If you don't approve of a lady who has had more than one sexual partner, then why don't you just keep up your search for perfection and move on without tearing her down first? Slut labelling sticks like shit to a blanket and is a sure fire way to smash someone's confidence to smithereens, if they genuinely care what people think. I'm 29 years old and pretty sure I'm not a slut but even now when I'm approached by a man, my after thoughts are, he probably only spoke to me because he's heard I'm a slag or thinks I look 'well up for it'.

Historically, nymphomania has referred to hypersexuality in women and \"satyriasis\" the same in men. \\u2060 As a clinical diagnosis, nymphomania is controversial. It is not considered a formal diagnosed disorder by mental health professionals. Including \"sexual addiction\" in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) - a set of standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders - has been suggested but as yet is not included, although hypersexuality is sometimes included as a symptom of other mental disorders.\\u2060 Nymphomania has also been used as a derogatory label to discredit women with high sex drives or sexual desires considered to be \"abnormal\". Labeling a woman a \"nymphomaniac\" is closely linked to slut-shaming where a woman is judged for having sex, enjoying sex or having sex with multiple partners. Sex positivity allows for the full spectrum of human sexual desires and means taking a non-judgemental stance towards someone\\'s sex life, no matter how much or how little sex they choose to have.\\u2060\\u2060 .\\u2060 .\\u2060 .\\u2060 .\\u2060 .\\u2060 Image by ??

       " '- Meet The Artists - Ariel Baillie️ Creative Artist I have been drawing since I was able to pick up a crayon. I have always loved arts and crafts and creating anything that came to mind. Growing up as a very nomadic child I was exposed to different parts of the world at a very young age which opened up my mind to a whole new perspective. I didnt start focusing on acrylic paintings until I moved to vancouver in 2018. The response I received from my pieces opened up opportunities I never thought could become a reality. It sparked something within me and I have never looked back. As each piece I created recieved such different interpretations it hit me to want to portray a message that could mean more to someone than just \"I like that\". This is where I met the beautiful mind of Aubree. I had done a couple sketches of females that I posted on an Instagram story and she asked me if she could use them. This being my first time that anyone has asked to collaborate on a piece I was Instantly intrigued. The piece she created blew me out of the water and I never thought I could see my sketches come to life the way she merged them together and put colour into it. I feel like this piece is where it all started for TPIF to come to light. To empower each other to create and be represented in the art world never has meant so much to me then this moment right now. To see creative minds of women come together and make an impact is exactly what we want to do with TPIF. The time is now to go for our dreams and create a reality with our goals. “Women don’t need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.” – Meghan Markle TPIF is created to empower women to use their gifts of creativity and show the arts community that they deserve the spotlight.

I participated in an action of taken an inappropriate photo sending it through social media and someone choosing to send it in to an account to post for thousands of people to see. It was an incident that was taken out of context, was entirely out of my control, and something I have learned to grow from. It hasn't been easy but I am learning to strive and thrive despite this incident. ”No one, not someone hiding behind an account, not the person who submitted this photo, NO ONE, is going to make me feel like I deserved to be publicly bashed and ridiculed for something that does not represent the whole truth.” if you want to read the full, painfully truthful story, head to the link in my bio. . . .\",\n",

       " \"Let's talk about sex. We all need it to be healthy, and yet our society has taught us to be ashamed of our desire for it. It is time to change this, and start talking about the elephant in the room. I've noticed men being ashamed of their sexuality, and physically pressuring women rather than verbalizing their desires first. I recognize the feminine has a deep wound around feeling pressured. I've noticed women being ashamed of their sexuality and not acting on desires out of fear of being 'slut shamed'. I recognize that the masculine has a deep wound around not being recieved. If we start talking more about sex, maybe we can start to talk about how to heal these wounds. Men, I encourage you to face your fear of rejection and verbalize your intent to potential partners. And do it without the physical pressure first (asking for consent when you are already making contact is pressure). The most respected I have ever felt was when a potential partner of mine was sitting across a table from me, hadn't made any physical contact all night, and told me that he wanted to have sex/asked me if the feeling was mutual. Be blunt with it, it is actually more respectful. Women, I encourage you to act on whatever feels good to your body and soul (and remember the power of your 'no' when it feels bad). Lets work to overcome our fears of being shamed by our freinds, family, or spiritual community. In ancient China the taoists would routinely have 'lunch parties' that modern society would now call 'orgies'. Sex was seen as a way to balance out the energies in each partner, and was encouraged in the tradition. How have we gotten where we are now?\",\n",

       " 'This is Megan Fox (). She is a actress and a model. She was in a lot of bluckbuster in the 2000\\'s and at the start of the 2010\\'s, and is known for her role\\'s in movies such as Transformers or Jennifer\\'s Body. Recently, I came upon an artcile about her, saying that she was one of the biggest victim of sexism in Hollywood, showing example of how. In every interviews she is doing, people only talk to her about her body, how she is the most beautiful woman in the world, that everyone is in love with her. They don\\'t talk to her about the movie, or anything else than her being sexy. They don\\'t see her for her work but only for what she look like and sexualize her for it. What happened to her, will probably not happened today, or not as much as she had to go through. But the fact that she had to, without anyone defending her or even just saying how rude, unprofessional and sexist it is to talk to a person like this, amaze me. The worst in this case, is that she once said that even though she had stories to tell and could have shared them during the movement, she didn\\'t do it, cause she felt that her stories weren\\'t worth. Because she was \"the most beautiful woman in the world\". What was taught to her is that, because she is pretty in the eyes of many she didn\\'t had a word to say, she was lucky to be beautiful and literally being the object of desir for many. This is also why we need equally with every gender but also in the gender itself. Because there are many women like Megan Fox, that were told that because they were beautiful, they should be happy about being desired and sexualized by men and women. And that they shouldn\\'t complained, because many wish they could be like them. Even if she didn\\'t told everything that happened to her, Megan Fox shared things, like the time when the director Michael Bay made her do an audition at his house, by washing his car in a bikini, while he was recording her. She also talks about how she was ahead of time, and how she was hate then for what women are praised now. If you want equallity, you have to fight for everyone, even the one that look like what society is telling us to look like. xxZ',\n",

       " \"When I was 18 I had the chance through my local Community College to study abroad in London, England for 3 months. As a person who had been passionate about theater and history and separated from my English mother and family, this was a trip of a lifetime, a chance to answer questions I'd always had. At the time, I was still dating my high school boyfriend and I told him how excited I was for it, wondering if he would want to come along. Upon hearing this, my abstinence-only parents told me that if he went I would have to stay home. It was so important to them that I didn't have sex before marriage that they were going to ostensibly let me miss out on this trip because, unsupervised in another country, they saw sex as inevitable--even though I wore a purity ring and had promised I wouldn't have sex before marriage and was terrified of getting pregnant out of wedlock because my parents did and my birth mother ultimately chose not to be with my dad and I anymore--I thought I could avoid that pain for my future kids. Thankfully my boyfriend didn't want to go on the trip so I went and it changed my life. I fell deeply in love with the Scottish land and met estranged cousins who have now become close family. Undecided on my life path, it was in London I dedicated myself to being a writer who would make a difference in the world while sitting in Hyde Park and read incredible literature on the Tube. I finally learned how to draw by sketching the Elgin marbles and saw Shakespeare on the Globe stage, a place I had read about as a childhood theater nerd countless times and wept at the incredible magnitude of humanity. Now I know more about Empire (Hey !!) and my relationship to my mothers, my parents, my body, my sexuality. But this obsession with virginity and abstinence still hurts me on a daily basis. Today it was a sting, remembering that my dad and I didn't used to have the relationship we have today and what it would have meant to me to have to miss that life-changing adventure because of my sexuality and my body. Sex is normal. Your body belongs to you. And we must stop lying to children about their bodies.\",\n",

Sexists comments about female chefs are popping up regularly in the news. I feel frustrated about them but I move on by venting to my husband. This time I’d like to vent here as I worked for HB between 2011-2013. Working for was one of my most influential experiences. I was part of the team when The Hind's Head won the Michelin . I worked every section in that kitchen including grill and sauce. I did 1month stage at The core team treated me as if I’d be stupid, used all the stagiers as cleaners and showed no respect towards them. I also worked a couple of days at Dinner by HB. The head pastry chef offered me a job after a dinner service; I was able to run the tipsy cake section without any training as their CDP was in the sh.t for the whole time. I moved on to work somewhere else and a few years later (2016) I had a baby. I worked in the kitchen until 32 weeks and returned to work when my son was 10 month old. I was doing mostly night shifts so he didn't have to spend the whole day at daycare. I slept 4 hours for 2 years. I ruined myself both physically and mentally. This made me realise there’s something wrong with the industry. There’s no support towards working mothers if it comes to chef jobs. When I read statements like above it breaks my heart, it hurts my feelings, I feel frustrated and angry. I also feel a huge amount of courage to speak up and stand up against this kind of douchebags. There would be more female chefs if the hours would be reasonable, the pay would be fair, there would be respect towards the employees, and if the employer could provide stability and flexibility. Giving a working a mother the next week's rota on Saturday night is simply not good enough.

Well no, not right, and the very talented actress Radhika Apte has finally said it for all of us. Radhika Apte has been always the talk of the town for speaking what she feels is right. Recently the actor opened up about her philosophy around love when she appeared on an episode of BFFs with Vogue Season 3, aired on Colors Infinity. Speaking about temptations Radhika said – “Of course you get tempted. You don’t have to be an actor to be tempted. In life, you meet so many people and there are so many wonderful people and you get tempted. Sometimes it’s a physical attraction, sometimes it’s just admiration and that can be very potent also and I think that’s beautiful. Why would you not address that aspect of your life?” She also commented on the fact that how sometimes we blame ourselves for the natural emotion of falling with many people at the same time – “I believe in falling in love with many people. I love too many people at the same time also on various levels and in various ways. Like how I could love dancing and acting, why can’t I love you and you in different ways?

Far too many college students are being raped and are afraid to report it. Women are subjected to sexual harassment, sexual bullying, and sexual pressure every day on the street, at work, and at home but are unable to speak truth to power or to report these sexual offenses. I’m Saying No! is written specifically for these women―women who are still afraid to speak up for themselves, women who need to learn how to do so, and women whose personal history of child sexual abuse or sexual assault as an adult has wounded them so much that they have lost their voice. Here, Beverly Engel―an internationally recognized psychotherapist and acclaimed advocate for victims of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse―offers a ground-breaking program to help all the women who have been silenced by past trauma, women who were raised to believe they didn’t have a right to say no, and women who have spoken out in the past only to go unheard. Bold and timely, I’m Saying No! offers women the encouragement, support, and guidelines they need in order to become the powerful women they are―women who believe in themselves and stand up for themselves. _ (RM5)',\n",

While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men, thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff, we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ As women, we seem to teeter in this fine line of \"if you\\'re not giving it up you\\'re a prude, but if you are you\\'re a slut\". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they\\'re too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health, we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image, and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let\\'s make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ •⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀',\n",

I learned to see a lot of negative things about me and the world. And that’s how I was creating my life since then. I was struggling with PTSD the last 4 years. Last year, I came across Louise Hay on YouTube. Then Abraham Hicks. At first I was just listening. Then I started to understand. Now I’m believing. The flashbacks/intrusive thoughts/negative thought habits had taken control of me. I’m 34 now. For the first time in my life, I’m in control. I’m in control of how I feel now. I’m no longer blaming anyone including my Mom, one of my abusers, because I now know that we are all doing the best we can with what we have from where we are at any time. I was walking one of my dogs today, and directly on my path, this bird transitioned. My first thought was superstition. OMG, a bad omen. Then I was like, thank you for sharing. That’s an old thought habit of fear. I choose to believe that everything is working out for me. That I am safe in the Universe and all life loves and supports me. Then I came home and found this video. It helped me realize, the bird is a symbol of the end of my dwelling and mourning of the past. And it’s my time now. I’ve paid the price. I’ve put enough in my vortex that I can just chill now. Chill, appreciate, follow my impulses, and amend along the way. Because as we all know, we can never get it wrong and it’s never done.

On the one hand: it’s only our stereotypical ideas about dresses that makes us think they’re “for girls”, and so why shouldn’t our sons wear dresses too? So the answer is that instead of not buying dresses for our daughters, we are instead open to all children wearing them, regardless of gender. On the other hand: it’s easy for me to say that as a mother to a daughter, but how many parents would actually feel comfortable buying dresses for their sons? And because dresses ARE seen as gendered for females, like it or not, the best way to go gender neutral is not to clothe her in dresses at all but instead in, say, babygros and shorts and t-shirts.

The stigma associated with talking about mental health and well being and receiving proper aid for it has resulted in approximately 300 million people suffering from depression worldwide. A study conducted by WHO in 2018 placed India at the top of the list of the most depressed countries of the world, a position which we shouldn’t be proud to hold. In today’s fast moving world, it is imperative to eradicate the taboo that prevails around mental health and sensitise people about the harms of neglecting it.

Only fans goes against every value I believe in when it comes to nudity and made me feel slutty sharing pictures in lingerie even though I only do this cause I genuinely love myself, look good and don’t see myself any different in lingerie or clothes. I needed to write this to remind myself that there are many women like me who will advocate for slut shaming, feminism and just treating the female body as a body not a piece of meat. I’m not a slut if I post nude picture. The body is more than sex. And the whole bullshit of playing into men’s desires is bullshit, men will sexualise you no matter what clothes or no clothes so they may aswell get to see the ass they can never have. If I ever wanted a mans attention I’d send him a far worse picture than what I would share in a private snap.

The bunny ears make it easy to be carried around too lol. My daughter finds comfort hugging her doll when she\\'s sleeping.

It seems everyone is thought to deserve body autonomy except us. The incredibly strict rulings in Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio are about policing women, not protecting fetuses or the women themselves. The world is a very closed off, regulated, and pro-shaming place as a woman. As more men escape repercussions of raping while womens lives remain forever changed, we are proving this is acceptable, that we are second class citizens. We are telling our girls to cover up and stay inside, while allowing our boys to act however they choose because they \"grow up slower.\" Take note of every woman who apologizes throughout the day and pay attention to if they are even apologizing for something they need to be sorry for, or if it\\'s simply been engrained in them to not take up too much space, be too loud, or ask too many questions. We\\'ve been conditioning the sexes into their roles for lifetimes without even questioning why and what that does to our society. We as artists and ceramicists have it in our own community, and I\\'m thankful to see us questioning practices and people speaking out for themselves and eachother.

So often, it’s easy to meet with friends, family and work colleagues and pass pleasantries. We British love to greet with ‘ How are you?’ But not intend an answer other than ‘fine thanks’! I find this tradition can lead to conversation devoid of meaning, as often the opportunity to connect deeply is lost with the first exchange. What if with each interaction we intend a deep connection that can enhance our belonging and filter out any feeling of isolation? And what if we can be inspired, learn, help others, or just laugh out loud through these deep connections. I’ve just finished reading Melinda Gates book ‘The Moment Of Lift’ In her closing paragraphs she talks about connection being more important than equality. And I have to agree, however, in order to understand Melinda’s point fully, read the book, it is one of the most important books I’ve read in recent times. If you’d like to attend a event where people come together devoid of labels, so that deep connection can be made through the stories told, then Scroll through to see the date for their next event partnering with one of my favourite brands Some of my best connections have been down to the excellent work and team do. ️️ . . +Male',\n",

My husband had that vice grip of ‘let’s just leave’ on my hand as my blood boiled. Are these salesmen even trained in sales, i.e. everyone is a potential customer, not just men?? That’s just my issue with their sales (lack of) skills & personalities - the mass produced marketing material they offer up is so overtly directed at men, it’s mind numbingly sexist to the point it is hard to find evidence another gender exists!! Oh wait, you might find a token (long haired yet helmeted) female (??) in a quad bike image, passenger of course, not actually in control of the machine!!

       " 'Stop calling me a nurse. Stop stereotyping on the basis of sex. Stop assuming the role of women in the workplace. Stop undermining my rights to have a career of my choice. Just stop. ⠀⠀ ⠀⠀ Let me just tell you truthfully, there hasn’t been a single day in the last two weeks that I’ve been in the OR where I haven’t been called a “nurse”. The worse part is, when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident, the shock on their face is even more offensive. Don’t get me wrong, I would be honored to be a nurse, it’s one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so it’s not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a “doctor”, is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether you’re a doctor, PA, nurse, pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a difference: when you see discrimination, of any kind, say something and leave a lasting impression. Here’s what I mean, in dental school, I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled, and said “no I am a dentist” and then moved on. I didn’t feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel it’s on the basis of gender, I smile, say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isn’t to fight with everyone, it’s to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something. And guess what, everyone has a role to play whether you’re a man or woman.',\n",

Sexual positivity promotes the view that sex is healthy for people and that people can experience their sexuality however they like, so long as they engage in safe and consensual practices. Being sex-positive means respecting the sexual freedom, choices and lifestyles of others. It eradicates any hierarchies that assert one kind of sexual practice as better or “more righteous” than another. Our culture can be a very “sex-negative” one in which, rather than allowing people to bond over something they all enjoy, social norms favor the act of putting others down for having sex. This is also known as “slut-shaming.” There’s a tendency to make moral judgments about individuals, mostly women, who have sex, especially if they do it “too often.” ️ Polyamory isn’t monogamy and it isn’t swinging, it’s being open to having loving relationships with different people of different sexes at the same time, and in that way learning to love yourself, too. It is also sex positive!\",\n",

       " 'TL;DR I enjoyed this book. I’ve just finished reading by Laura Bates. It was a real eye-opener! I found the chapter on women in politics particularly interesting: “Around the world, women are enormously underrepresented in politics... in February 2013, just 20% of parliamentary seats in the world were held by women”. With women being largely outnumbered while ideas are being discussed, it comes with the consequence that policy decisions often disproportionately disadvantage women. For example, women make up two thirds of public-sector workers so budget cuts in this area result in an larger increase in unemployment for women than for men. And, since the majority of primary careers of children, the disabled and the elderly are women, “around three quarters of all cuts to benefits come out of women’s pockets”. Previously I didn’t pay much attention to politics. But I am now pledging to pay attention and to support the women in government who are fighting to ensure that the impacts on women are taken into consideration! Hopefully one day we will have a government with a which is representative of our population as a whole and people of colour, LGBTQ people and disabled people are also represented!

One thing that really bothers me about how we express displeasure about people (women especially) is how we quickly switch it up to body-shaming and slut-shaming. People just start with the \"see her fallen breasts\", \"fat legs\", \"shapeless\", \"she sleeps around for money\" and recently, \"she has body odor\". Now there is a whole song dedicated to one person about something as sensitive as alleged \"body odor\". Why do we feel the need to be rude or hurtful with our approach to criticizing ourselves and others? Does it make them better or do we just do it to make ourselves feel better? . Sometimes, I try to imagine if I was walking down the street and 5,000 or 10,000 people shouted such things to me. You should too before you go ahead to add to the numbers. The world is stressful enough for us to keep spreading such insensitivity/negativity with reckless abandon, lest we become even worse than the very people we criticize. .

       " 'Happy pub day to THE GREATER FREEDOM! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ This memoir is giving me so much food for thought. Alya Mooro eloquently describes the pressures experienced by Middle Eastern women, some of which are achingly familiar and others which are unique to her culture. (Disclaimer: it\\'s published by my employer.) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ I just finished a chapter about attitudes to sex. Mooro describes how her mother explained sex to her: don\\'t do it before marriage or no one will love you. \"Where was any mention of my desires or my feelings in that conversation?\" she asks. Her question made me reflect on my own learning experiences - and how I relied on fiction to fill the knowledge void. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ At school, we had (laughingly incomplete) sex ed focused on periods and erections. The baseline was set: for women the focus was procreation, for men their urges. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Then my father took me aside and told me that society was unfair: boys could sleep around but girls couldn\\'t. 11-year-old-me was too naive to question WHO those boys were sleeping with, or why gender inequality was an acceptable status quo. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Years later, when my mother finally sat me down to have \"the talk\", it lasted all of one awkward minute where she obliquely asked if I was being safe. (As always, the onus falls on women.) ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ No one taught me about love, about consent, about desire. If it weren\\'t for fiction, I would have had an entirely one dimensional view about sex as a currency between genders. Something that my value would be judged on by, as Mooro puts it, the invisible jury of society. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ But while books helped plug the void, all-too-often fiction (and especially fantasy) has a warped representation of relationships. It\\'s only now as an adult that I realise how damaging fiction can be in romanticising unacceptable behaviour - particularly in genres targeted at teens. I can\\'t help but wonder how many girls are learning about sex and consent through books like I did... and how much YA authors should take responsibility for changing the narrative of what a healthy relationship looks like. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ What good or bad examples of fictional relationships can you think of?',\n",

We went pumpkin picking this morning at Kenyon Hall Farm, which is something we do every year. I will be using mine now to make pumpkin spice cupcakes over the next week or so, which are amazing (if I do say so myself ) . Anyway, whilst we were there, I bumped into someone who caused me some trauma in my past... Long story short, about 7 years ago I was working in a pub in Warrington. I was quite good friends with the assistant manager there for a while, until he started to get a bit too friendly. It started with him being playful, and kind of flirty. That then progressed into him basically assaulting me every time we worked together on shift (which was about 4-5 times a week). Eventually I reported it to the BDM, and was told that it was just banter, and that they were very disappointed in me for wanting to take this further. I had to have a grievance meeting with four middle-aged men. . He was promoted to a general manager, and given his own pub. This was their solution to him sexually assaulting members of staff. . He now lives in the same town as me, and this is not the first time I've ran into him; the last time I had a bad panic attack in my car after seeing him. Today time was the first time he actually saw me. He looked quite shocked, but he more than likely won't dwell on it. I, however, went into panic-mode, my heart was pounding out of my chest, and I felt sick! Tom was there this time, which helped me stay calm, but it's hit me with a horrible low mood, which I'll probably have for the rest of the day. . It was this point in my life that I was diagnosed with a panic disorder, which is why I react the way I do when I see him. I never even feel like this is something I can talk about, because I was made to feel in the wrong. I wasn't even going to post it because I was worried it would seem attention-seeking, but I hate that I have to keep quiet about this stuff, whilst this guy goes about his life, probably not giving a F. .

If you’ve experienced abuse or trauma, you may develop a sense of disconnectedness from things you’d normally enjoy (especially when you feel like no one understands why you’re suffering). You may also become disconnected from your routines like eating, showering, going outside, answering messages, checking email, or even going to work. (Yes. Even things you need in order to stay alive). Sometimes even the littlest perceived benefit to yourself will still seem evil and threatening. Society misunderstands further when people make fun of survivors who engage in “self-care,” thinking it’s just an excuse to walk a dog, do yoga, or take an extra break during the day at work. Self-care isn’t about treating yourself when you need some comfort, it’s about relearning your brain chemistry and redirecting the trauma energy (the same energy it took to overcome the most impossible situations of your life) into a positive thought or process rather than a destructive thought/behavior (like suicide).

We discussed in vivid detail (together and with our videographer) how we wanted the scene portrayed. It started by me walking out of a store to see a man waiting outside, but watching me. This is normal everyday life. But his body language portrayed differently. His arms lowered when we made eye contact and he quickly looked away. I continued walking and then noticed he discarded something from his hands and turned my direction. These are all signs. We had a few suggestions that later in the video when I notice he is following me into the parking lot that I should run or show a scared expression on my face. But I disagreed. Why? Because I'm tired of videos showing women helpless and scared. And although this specific scenario was being acted out, this has happened to me before. I had a man follow me out to my car one time. I was able to avoid anything happening because I had a plan. Was it scary? Yes. Was I shaking? Yes. But I was in control and a potentially dangerous situation was avoided. And that's what I want our material to teach others how to do too.  How to recognize signs.  How to coordinate a plan in a matter of seconds.  How to be in control. Because even if you are only one second ahead of a threat, YOU are still in control.\",\n",

The tipping point was a professional failing of his, which was obvious to others, but would I have done anything if the problem had of just carried on being manageable? . The answer is, Im not sure. But my mind wandered back to what Id read in Everyday Sexism, the stats on reporting sexual harassment, and the change that is brought on when we stand for said change. It makes me feel more comfortable. . But I also worry - at the back of my mind are the justifications of the mans behaviour a man of his time and the impact it could have on future interactions. . Are the worries of repercussions your biggest fear of reporting inappropriate behaviour (aside from personal safety)? Or internal justifications? .

I am one of those people who has been sexually violated, and when I was younger, I can say that I was not as respectful of the boundaries of others as I should have been. I am also one of those people who doesn\\'t mind most physical contact. Outside of the times that I was sexually violated or have had my butt pinched, I can think of only one time that anyone touched me when it really bothered me and that was very innocent. A guy told me \"thank you\" for something I had done for him and put his hand briefly between my shoulders. I don\\'t know why it bothered me, but it felt like the devil had run through my body. Had he kept his hand there, I probably would have asked him to stop, and he probably would have respected that. Being able to ask for your boundaries to be respected, and having them respected is an extremely important thing. One of the things the movement is bringing to the forefront of discussion is the importance of having one\\'s boundaries honored and respected. No matter who someone is, no matter how much authority or influence they may have, they have no right to touch you in a way that you are not willing to allow. The only exception might be an effort to subdue someone who is resisting arrest, being violent or in process of violating someone. This whole discussion about physical boundaries is one that society needs to continue. It is about time it was brought out of the shadows and into the open light of scrutiny. Our bodies are the one possession within our absolute domain. Our comfort or lack of comfort with being touched is our own business and whatever boundaries we set need to be respected. Even those who violate others would not want certain touch from certian people. The Golden Rule can therefore be applied in reverse. Do not do to others what you would not want done to you.',\n",

Natasha is my Godsister. I was visiting her and her family at their farm in upstate NY and one afternoon she and I were in a field, listening to music, shooting, talking and this moment happened - a young woman who was completely lost in her own world, not performing for any gaze, but rather, celebrating her womanhood and embracing her own power as a women. In 2016 I posted this image on Instagram. And it was censored. I was stunned, and then outraged, especially considering some of the imagery that shows up in my feed and in the discovery section. To each their own, but naked women posing for men are fine, but this image, this needs to be censored? It felt like Instagram was telling women that their bodies are shameful, unless they are being used for the purposes of male satisfaction and that their womanhood should not be celebrated. And I reposted the image saying just that. The image was removed again and my account was immediately blacklisted and buried in the algorithm. Overnight my account became invisible. Its been that way ever since. Now, I have never really put a whole lot of stock in the whole Insta fame world and I dont particularly care. However, Instagram is a publishing house now and like it or not, as a photographer a lot of my jobs come down to clients looking at my Instagram - brands will or will not hire you based on your follower count and interactions. So, Im calling you out Instagram. Im not the only one youve buried. And Im tired of you telling me what I want to see in my timeline, because your algorithm sucks.

She responded, in No one ever asks what a mans place in the Revolution is.1 To many, the BPP conjures up a hypermasculine image of Black men in leather coats and berets carrying shotguns. Yet at its heightaccording to a survey conducted by Chairman Bobby Seale in 1969the party membership was over 60 percent female.2 These women were integral to every aspect of party life, including serving as prominent leaders. Yet until recently, much of their work has been sidelined in historical research and popular media. Recent scholarship is shedding light on the role of women in the BPP and the Black struggle more broadly. For activists involved in todays strugglesfrom women who have been at the forefront of the Black Lives Matter movement, to the widespread impact and identification with (which among other things has prompted a reckoning with sexism within activist spaces), to the popular use of the term intersectionality to make sense of the interlocking forces of racial, class, and gendered oppressionthe experience of women in the BPP offers a host of lessons. The BPP emerged in an era of global mass revolt. In the United States, the struggle against anti-Black racism was the central flashpoint that opened up a mass radicalization around a whole host of issuesfrom war and imperialism, to womens and LGBT oppression, to class inequality and capitalism. By the end of the 1960s, millions of young Americans believed a revolution was necessary in this country and thousands flooded into revolutionary groups like the BPP. The BPPs Ten Point Program outlined a vision for liberation, encompassing demands for jobs, housing, education, and self-determination. In its early phase, the partys activity focused on point the fight against police brutality. Making use of their Constitutional rights, the Panthers boldly asserted their intention to use arms to defend the Black community from police violence.',\n",

       " 'Slut-shaming. What a really interesting word. Personally, Im a user of this term, and Im against slut-shaming. Im against people shaming someone because they do things that apparently a slut would do  wearing heavy makeup, wearing a dress of a particular length, etc, etc.., Also when people shame rape victims for the time/place/existence of theirs, I tell them to not slut-shame them. Stop slut-shaming women is something Ive advocated for a lot. I tell people not to slut-shame someone, because a slut is a bad thing to be  thats what Ive been meaning. Well, thats what the usage means  its a derogatory, bad term. But I think I need to present forth why this caught my curiosity and got me into A slut is someone who has sexual relationships with many men. Also, someone like a prostitute. Dictionary defines slut as a woman who has many casual sexual partners, a sexually promiscuous person. Also surely, the term slut doesnt refer to a woman who is a rapist. In wokeness, having sex is not bad. Being sexually promiscuous though, is unhealthy, but thats a lot complicated too, and were not talking about that. But the whole idea of asking people to stop shaming a girl as a slut, because the word is derogatory  is it derogatory because sex is immoral? Is it derogatory because it is a WOMAN who is sexually promiscuous, and thus immoral? Is it derogatory because being a prostitute is... bad? (Which we arent talking about now either, for theres so much complications when it comes to prostitution.) If having casual sex is bad/derogatory, why is there no such thing as a slut-shaming a man? There is no equivalent term for slut for a sexually promiscuous man as far as I know. Im not comparing men and women, nor am I saying that thereby men should be slut-shamed. But Im pointing out how this simply points out to the idea of sexual oppression and control we have. Do I mean that its simply okay for someone to shame someone as a slut and I dont have to mind about it? No. But Im talking about WHAT makes someone a slut, who is a slut, how people treat a slut and why we SHAME a slut. .',\n",

Whether or not you yourself are non-monogamous or curious about it, you are likely to encounter someone in your community who is, and this is a great book to help understand different avenues for creating relationship and empathy for those friends. For some, non-monogamy is considered a choice and for others it may be a deeper part of their personality. There is no 'better' or 'more enlightened' way to organize your relationship(s). There is, however, the reality that we live in a monogamous oriented society where most of us have not had as many, if any, solid examples of nonmonogamy. Also, slut shaming is still very much a part of the culture that we are collectively and intentionally replacing. Slut shaming is just one example of how we are subconsciously, or more overtly, coerced into monogamous lifestyles without free choice. One of my biggest take always from this book is how they gently break down all the ways we may try and coerce a relationship to be a certain way. The difficult conversations that include our fears, jealousy, judgements, anger, and insecurities of all sorts are so easily bypassed because they truly are difficult. Practicing these conversations and giving yourself space to explore these uncomfortable spaces is necessary for fulfilling relationships regardless of monogamy or nonmonogamy.

I dont know if ever happen to you but when you come back to your home with previous day party clothes and everyone look at you, you feel fucking humiliated and ashamed. No one should feel that way just for having some natural pleasure in they lives. .... Lets stop the slut shaming or walk of shame stigma. Please, it hurts our esteem. ....

       " 'The following is an abridged excerpt from Christina Hoff Sommers\\' brilliant book, The War Against Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the school holiday for girls introduced by the Ms. Foundation for Women, is now in its ninth year. For the first few years, it was a girls-only event. For their part, the Ms. organizers remain adamantly opposed to including boys. In 1996, Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, began working with some feminist men\\'s groups to design a separate holiday for boys. If boys had their own day, the pressure would be off. The first Son\\'s Day was planned for Sunday, October 20, 1996. October was especially desirable because, as the Ms. planners pointed out, \"October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month, so there will be lots of activities scheduled.\" Here are some of the ways \"Son\\'s Day\" was to be Take your sonor \\'son for a day\\'to an event that focuses on ending men\\'s violence against women. Call the Family Violence Prevention Fund at 800-END-ABUSE for information. Plan a game or sport in which the contest specifically does not keep score or declare a winner. Invite the community to watch and celebrate boys playing on teams for the sheer joy of playing. Since Son\\'s Day is on Sunday, make sure your son is involved in preparing the family for the work and school week ahead. This helping lay out clothes for siblings and making lunches. For boys not exhausted by all the fun and excitement of the day\\'s activities, the Ms. planners had a suggestion for the Take your son grocery shopping then help him plan and prepare the family\\'s evening meal on Son\\'s Day. As the Ms. staff had planned it, Son\\'s Day would not even give the boys a day off from school. ====== Continue the book',\n",

       " 'When I was 14 ,my high school English teacher Mr Rogers used to make me stand in the corner. When I would refuse, he would step towards me while I was seated at my desk, stand over me , sometimes with an erect penis and demand that I comply with his obscene and obviously sexually motivated punishments. During parent teacher conference, my Mom was shocked as Mr Rogers said I had a behavior problem and he claimed I was not college bound because if It. My Mom knew better as I had a box of academic awards and never had a teacher claim I was disruptive. After the conference she asked me if he did anything inappropriate , as she was creeped out by how often Mr Rogers used the word discipline during the meeting. I was so embarrassed that I allowed him to do this weird sexual stuff to me instead of finding the courage to walk out of class, that I told my Mom nothing happened, thus allowing him to do this to me for the rest of the semester. One time I even started my period while he was making me stand in the corner and he refused to let me go to the rest room. Sometimes boys in the class would make comments about girls bodies while we were standing in the corner (not their fault, they were kids too). It was HELLISH The police department stated that even if 100 former students witnessed Mr Rogers get an erection, that its not a prosecutable crime. As a former educator and child and family services contractor, I know what men like him are capable of. his actions are indicative of sexual deviancy. Ive had an easy time reporting things that have happened to me as an adult, but the district did not make this easy. They first accused me of not complying with the investigation because I did not want to sit down with Mr Rogers at the school he abused me at and sat on my complaint for over a month because the Director of HR wanted to wait until summer is over. inschools',\n",

       " 'Warning! This caption/rant contains naughty words.  Ive seen this post probably ten times in the last week and it is annoying the shit out of me. When someone posts something like this they assume it shows that they are more evolved and are doing the right thing. What it actually shows is that they are a judgmental piece of work.   So what if someone is hoeing around. As long as they are safe and honest with their partners about their intentions, why should we care? It is 2019. I thought we had begun to move past all this judgmental sex shit. If someone wants to go around and fuck half the eastern seaboard what gives us the right to judge them? And whos to say that they arent also healing at the same time? Speaking of healing, arent we supposed to be focused on that instead of paying attention to what everyone else is doing?  A major step in healing post-divorce is taking a hard look in the mirror. Now, I am not talking about extreme examples. Yes, I am aware that there is abuse and stuff like that. But most marriages fail because of two people, not one. Judgmental posts like this make me wonder if the poster has bothered to take a real look at themselves.  Go ahead and judge. Keep pointing your finger. But be prepared and accept that people will point it back at you - and this is exactly what Im doing now. The world needs more acceptance, not judgment. Focus on healing and stay in your own lane.  ',\n",

No more self-blaming, done with feeling victimised, and embracing that I have survived through all that so that I can be the change the society needs. This is what I have to say My hymen doesnt define my womanhood. My virginity shouldnt be a tick-off for marriage proposals. I am more than just a sexual being. My choice of lifestyle, my choice of clothing and my existence is not a reason for anyone to sexually abuse me. I will not be blamed for how the society has raised men to see women as sexual tools before anything else. It wasnt my fault and it never will be. I didnt ask for it when I was 5 years old, when I was 14, 19 or 22 years old. But I lived with the guilt because I was afraid of the society. I was afraid of the shame I would bring to my family because of what adult men did to me and I am done with it! I still struggle with anxiety, there are still trigger points that gets to me. I stopped running from them, instead now I just find ways to overcome them. I make conscious choices to not allow those men to be within my life and surrounding. I made my stand because in the end, whether I like it or not, they are my demons to battle and I am ready to fight my grounds.

Is men\\'s sexual wellbeing grossly misunderstood and considered secondary to women\\'s?

Namun, record pertama terhadap perjuangan ini dilakukan pada abad 19 dan abad 20 awal. Dalam tahap ini, perjuangan disebut sebagai \"First Wave Feminism\". Para wanita pejuang feminisme zaman dulu memperjuangkan hak-hak politik, seperti hak voting, dan hak ekonomi wanita menikah, seperti bekerja atau memiliki properti. Pejuang First Wave SUSAN B.

       " 'For your viewing pleasures... These are the final 3 installments of gallery artist s project for I have been working on this project with MoMA going through their archive and their collection. Im going to be releasing new short videos every few weeks from this series. I wanted to think about the meaning and position of all of MoMAs beautiful things in our time of image saturation and overwhelming choice. My project is loosely inspired by John Bergers seminal 1970s video series Ways of Seeing, updated for our time. Bergers project was a series of four 30-minute videos made for the BBC in 1972 as a reaction to the ways that television and new forms of commodity advertising were using art historical strategies in order to seduce consumers. His work critiqued the ways that images are used by those in power to make their interests seem inevitable or natural, and he demonstrates these power dynamics by looking at advertising, historical painting, and television. In my own project, I am similarly exploring how values and social norms are constructed and reinforced through art historical objects and popular images. The videos connect the power of art history and advertising to new issues around social media, contemporary feminism and the movement, technology and the intensified life of images, and news media and truth in the current moment. I wanted to think about the meaning and position of all of MoMAs beautiful things in our time of image saturation and overwhelming choice.',\n",

We hate being catcalled for wearing clothes that make us happy we might not be doing it for MALE attention, because its not all about you! Sometimes we just enjoy wearing these clothes, and we dont think we should be harassed by you for doing so!). We hate being paid less than men. We hate being disbelieved or mocked if we are raped or sexually assaulted. We hate being told it has something to do with our clothes, or our attitudes, or our status as women. We hate being frightened to report. We DONT hate men, think that we are better than everyone else, think that we should all ditch bras or stop shaving (unless we want to!), think that women should all become boss ladies (unless we want to!), or think that all men are fuckboys. We want equal rights for all; no matter our race, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity, class status, pay grade, weight, or fashion style. Sometimes we scream too loud because we are frustrated. Because we feel oppressed and alienated. Because we have lived under the rule of a patriarchal society for centuries.

       " 'I \"experted\" for Annakeara Stinson\\'s piece on toxic masculinity, a term which in my view is often assumed to refer to the most debased of actions like rape, sexual harassment, violence, aggression, and which sometimes includes the \"boys will be boys\" explanation for a whole range of behaviors. But the way I see it, so often it is our more subtle everyday actions and beliefs that underpin this toxic system and which we need to consider. These are things like the view that women are just better care givers than men, or that men are less emotional than women, or that it would be weird for a woman to pay on a date with a man, since that is how women know men are interested, and then there is common defense of chivalry as a cherished tradition by caring men who just want to protect women. These are forms of benevolent sexism and they uphold a deeply entrenched system that divides behaviors and characteristics into male and female and then punishes anyone who strays from this binary script. So while many people are comfortable addressing the more obvious forms of toxicity, since so much benevolent sexism is presented as complimentary to women and is often supported by them, it is a lot harder to critique without being seen as petty or reactionary. But defaulting to this view is a slippery slope that then allows us to support increasingly hostile actions and makes us less likely to fight against gender based injustice overall. So I talk about that here. Link in bio.',\n",

He says, I know this is probably weird, but I just need to Ive been going through a lot, especially with my girl. Im in a committed relationship though. And, I just wanna say you are very beautiful. But, when you walked in, I looked at your body and started having bad thoughts. I know you get this a lot and I just wanted to say that I was sorry for that. Because I am nervous, taken aback, I tell him that Ive been objectified by men, some to the point of assault. My ass has been slapped. Thighs caressed. One man tried to touch my vagina through my jeans. I am wearing a dingy Lilo & Stich tee and sweat pants today. Ive worn dresses. Been fully clothed and still called slut because of my body shape.

'Someone who sleeps with anyone and everyone', 'someone who just looks slutty', 'someone who's got loads of kids by loads of different men', 'someone who works in the sex industry'. My usual response is 'hmmm ok then', but lately I've started to respond a bit differently. What is it to you if a lady decides to sleep with 1 man or 10,000 men? Who gave you the right to label her? If she's happy, safe and not hurting anybody, then what business is it of yours? If you don't approve of a lady who has had more than one sexual partner, then why don't you just keep up your search for perfection and move on without tearing her down first? Slut labelling sticks like shit to a blanket and is a sure fire way to smash someone's confidence to smithereens, if they genuinely care what people think. I'm 29 years old and pretty sure I'm not a slut but even now when I'm approached by a man, my after thoughts are, he probably only spoke to me because he's heard I'm a slag or thinks I look 'well up for it'. These words are damaging and if I'm totally honest, pretty fucking annoying. My philosophy is, there are no such thing as sluts, if you mind your own damn business\",\n",

       " ' Nymphomania, or hypersexuality, refers to an extremely frequent or suddenly increased libido. Historically, nymphomania has referred to hypersexuality in women and \"satyriasis\" the same in men.  As a clinical diagnosis, nymphomania is controversial. It is not considered a formal diagnosed disorder by mental health professionals. Including \"sexual addiction\" in the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) - a set of standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders - has been suggested but as yet is not included, although hypersexuality is sometimes included as a symptom of other mental disorders. Nymphomania has also been used as a derogatory label to discredit women with high sex drives or sexual desires considered to be \"abnormal\". Labeling a woman a \"nymphomaniac\" is closely linked to slut-shaming where a woman is judged for having sex, enjoying sex or having sex with multiple partners. Sex positivity allows for the full spectrum of human sexual desires and means taking a non-judgemental stance towards someone\\'s sex life, no matter how much or how little sex they choose to have. . . . . .

       " '- Meet The Artists - Ariel Baillie Creative Artist I have been drawing since I was able to pick up a crayon. I have always loved arts and crafts and creating anything that came to mind. Growing up as a very nomadic child I was exposed to different parts of the world at a very young age which opened up my mind to a whole new perspective. I didnt start focusing on acrylic paintings until I moved to vancouver in 2018. The response I received from my pieces opened up opportunities I never thought could become a reality. It sparked something within me and I have never looked back. As each piece I created recieved such different interpretations it hit me to want to portray a message that could mean more to someone than just \"I like that\". This is where I met the beautiful mind of Aubree. I had done a couple sketches of females that I posted on an Instagram story and she asked me if she could use them. This being my first time that anyone has asked to collaborate on a piece I was Instantly intrigued. The piece she created blew me out of the water and I never thought I could see my sketches come to life the way she merged them together and put colour into it. I feel like this piece is where it all started for TPIF to come to light. To empower each other to create and be represented in the art world never has meant so much to me then this moment right now. To see creative minds of women come together and make an impact is exactly what we want to do with TPIF. The time is now to go for our dreams and create a reality with our goals. Women dont need to find a voice, they have a voice, and they need to feel empowered to use it, and people need to be encouraged to listen.  Meghan Markle TPIF is created to empower women to use their gifts of creativity and show the arts community that they deserve the spotlight. Once we allow women to understand and exercise their power, they can remake the world.',\n",

It is time to change this, and start talking about the elephant in the room. I've noticed men being ashamed of their sexuality, and physically pressuring women rather than verbalizing their desires first. I recognize the feminine has a deep wound around feeling pressured. I've noticed women being ashamed of their sexuality and not acting on desires out of fear of being 'slut shamed'. I recognize that the masculine has a deep wound around not being recieved. If we start talking more about sex, maybe we can start to talk about how to heal these wounds. Men, I encourage you to face your fear of rejection and verbalize your intent to potential partners. And do it without the physical pressure first (asking for consent when you are already making contact is pressure). The most respected I have ever felt was when a potential partner of mine was sitting across a table from me, hadn't made any physical contact all night, and told me that he wanted to have sex/asked me if the feeling was mutual. Be blunt with it, it is actually more respectful. Women, I encourage you to act on whatever feels good to your body and soul (and remember the power of your 'no' when it feels bad). Lets work to overcome our fears of being shamed by our freinds, family, or spiritual community. In ancient China the taoists would routinely have 'lunch parties' that modern society would now call 'orgies'. Sex was seen as a way to balance out the energies in each partner, and was encouraged in the tradition. How have we gotten where we are now?\",\n",

Amitabh shows up one hour into the film! 2 stars out of 10 instead of 1 for the only delightful a singing cameo by Miss Usha Iyer, whom we all know as Usha Uthup now. In a white and gold saree, big red bindi in place she did a medley mashup with presence, humour, and that voice! I mean, she throws \"I married a female wrestler\" and \"Be bop a Lula\" in the mix!

       " 'This is Megan Fox (). She is a actress and a model. She was in a lot of bluckbuster in the 2000\\'s and at the start of the 2010\\'s, and is known for her role\\'s in movies such as Transformers or Jennifer\\'s Body. Recently, I came upon an artcile about her, saying that she was one of the biggest victim of sexism in Hollywood, showing example of how. In every interviews she is doing, people only talk to her about her body, how she is the most beautiful woman in the world, that everyone is in love with her. They don\\'t talk to her about the movie, or anything else than her being sexy. They don\\'t see her for her work but only for what she look like and sexualize her for it. What happened to her, will probably not happened today, or not as much as she had to go through. But the fact that she had to, without anyone defending her or even just saying how rude, unprofessional and sexist it is to talk to a person like this, amaze me. The worst in this case, is that she once said that even though she had stories to tell and could have shared them during the movement, she didn\\'t do it, cause she felt that her stories weren\\'t worth. Because she was \"the most beautiful woman in the world\". What was taught to her is that, because she is pretty in the eyes of many she didn\\'t had a word to say, she was lucky to be beautiful and literally being the object of desir for many. This is also why we need equally with every gender but also in the gender itself. Because there are many women like Megan Fox, that were told that because they were beautiful, they should be happy about being desired and sexualized by men and women. And that they shouldn\\'t complained, because many wish they could be like them. Even if she didn\\'t told everything that happened to her, Megan Fox shared things, like the time when the director Michael Bay made her do an audition at his house, by washing his car in a bikini, while he was recording her. She also talks about how she was ahead of time, and how she was hate then for what women are praised now. If you want equallity, you have to fight for everyone, even the one that look like what society is telling us to look like. xxZ',\n",

       " \"When I was 18 I had the chance through my local Community College to study abroad in London, England for 3 months. As a person who had been passionate about theater and history and separated from my English mother and family, this was a trip of a lifetime, a chance to answer questions I'd always had. At the time, I was still dating my high school boyfriend and I told him how excited I was for it, wondering if he would want to come along. Upon hearing this, my abstinence-only parents told me that if he went I would have to stay home. It was so important to them that I didn't have sex before marriage that they were going to ostensibly let me miss out on this trip because, unsupervised in another country, they saw sex as inevitable--even though I wore a purity ring and had promised I wouldn't have sex before marriage and was terrified of getting pregnant out of wedlock because my parents did and my birth mother ultimately chose not to be with my dad and I anymore--I thought I could avoid that pain for my future kids. Thankfully my boyfriend didn't want to go on the trip so I went and it changed my life. I fell deeply in love with the Scottish land and met estranged cousins who have now become close family. Undecided on my life path, it was in London I dedicated myself to being a writer who would make a difference in the world while sitting in Hyde Park and read incredible literature on the Tube. I finally learned how to draw by sketching the Elgin marbles and saw Shakespeare on the Globe stage, a place I had read about as a childhood theater nerd countless times and wept at the incredible magnitude of humanity. Now I know more about Empire (Hey !!) and my relationship to my mothers, my parents, my body, my sexuality. But this obsession with virginity and abstinence still hurts me on a daily basis. Today it was a sting, remembering that my dad and I didn't used to have the relationship we have today and what it would have meant to me to have to miss that life-changing adventure because of my sexuality and my body. Sex is normal. Your body belongs to you. And we must stop lying to children about their bodies.\",\n",

Sexists comments about female chefs are popping up regularly in the news. I feel frustrated about them but I move on by venting to my husband. This time Id like to vent here as I worked for HB between 2011-2013. Working for was one of my most influential experiences. I was part of the team when The Hind's Head won the Michelin . I worked every section in that kitchen including grill and sauce. I did 1month stage at The core team treated me as if Id be stupid, used all the stagiers as cleaners and showed no respect towards them. I also worked a couple of days at Dinner by HB. The head pastry chef offered me a job after a dinner service; I was able to run the tipsy cake section without any training as their CDP was in the sh.t for the whole time. I moved on to work somewhere else and a few years later (2016) I had a baby. I worked in the kitchen until 32 weeks and returned to work when my son was 10 month old. I was doing mostly night shifts so he didn't have to spend the whole day at daycare. I slept 4 hours for 2 years. I ruined myself both physically and mentally. This made me realise theres something wrong with the industry. Theres no support towards working mothers if it comes to chef jobs. When I read statements like above it breaks my heart, it hurts my feelings, I feel frustrated and angry. I also feel a huge amount of courage to speak up and stand up against this kind of douchebags. There would be more female chefs if the hours would be reasonable, the pay would be fair, there would be respect towards the employees, and if the employer could provide stability and flexibility. Giving a working a mother the next week's rota on Saturday night is simply not good enough.

       " 'This week we are talking about women\\'s sexual health, as it is an important but very taboo part of women\\'s overall wellbeing. While we normally have no problem talking about sexual health in terms of men, thinking about sexual health for women still seems to require a lot of sensitivity. so before we dive into all that fun stuff, we first need to talk about another important thing women face with their sexual health- slut shaming.     As women, we seem to teeter in this fine line of \"if you\\'re not giving it up you\\'re a prude, but if you are you\\'re a slut\". What about just letting women do their thing safely and happily? Giving women the permission to love themselves in such an intimate manner. How can women truly explore their sexual health if they\\'re too ashamed to talk about it in the first place. We need to empower one another and provide a safe space to talk about sex for women. So this week while we focus on intimacy and sexual health, we also encourage you to look at your own relationship with yourself around your body image, and thoughts of yourself in relation to sexual health. Let\\'s make it okay to learn about sex & intimacy.   ',\n",

       " 'Birds and butterflies have been communicating with me quite a bit recently. I grew up enduring a lot of emotional, physical, sexual abuse and rape. I learned to see a lot of negative things about me and the world. And thats how I was creating my life since then. I was struggling with PTSD the last 4 years. Last year, I came across Louise Hay on YouTube. Then Abraham Hicks. At first I was just listening. Then I started to understand. Now Im believing. The flashbacks/intrusive thoughts/negative thought habits had taken control of me. Im 34 now. For the first time in my life, Im in control. Im in control of how I feel now. Im no longer blaming anyone including my Mom, one of my abusers, because I now know that we are all doing the best we can with what we have from where we are at any time. I was walking one of my dogs today, and directly on my path, this bird transitioned. My first thought was superstition. OMG, a bad omen. Then I was like, thank you for sharing. Thats an old thought habit of fear. I choose to believe that everything is working out for me. That I am safe in the Universe and all life loves and supports me. Then I came home and found this video. It helped me realize, the bird is a symbol of the end of my dwelling and mourning of the past. And its my time now. Ive paid the price. Ive put enough in my vortex that I can just chill now. Chill, appreciate, follow my impulses, and amend along the way. Because as we all know, we can never get it wrong and its never done. Thank you.',\n",

       " 'Todays dresses. Is there a place for dresses in a gender neutral wardrobe? My daughter wears gender neutral clothes in terms of colours and motifs, but Im having this dilemma. On the one its only our stereotypical ideas about dresses that makes us think theyre for girls, and so why shouldnt our sons wear dresses too? So the answer is that instead of not buying dresses for our daughters, we are instead open to all children wearing them, regardless of gender. On the other its easy for me to say that as a mother to a daughter, but how many parents would actually feel comfortable buying dresses for their sons? And because dresses ARE seen as gendered for females, like it or not, the best way to go gender neutral is not to clothe her in dresses at all but instead in, say, babygros and shorts and t-shirts.

The stigma associated with talking about mental health and well being and receiving proper aid for it has resulted in approximately 300 million people suffering from depression worldwide. A study conducted by WHO in 2018 placed India at the top of the list of the most depressed countries of the world, a position which we shouldnt be proud to hold. In todays fast moving world, it is imperative to eradicate the taboo that prevails around mental health and sensitise people about the harms of neglecting it.

I wrote this post quickly and in the moment of being disappointed that everything I ever believed about nudity, such as it shouldnt be sexualised and instead respected as an art, was thrown out the window with young girls willingly sexualising themselves for cash. Only fans goes against every value I believe in when it comes to nudity and made me feel slutty sharing pictures in lingerie even though I only do this cause I genuinely love myself, look good and dont see myself any different in lingerie or clothes. I needed to write this to remind myself that there are many women like me who will advocate for slut shaming, feminism and just treating the female body as a body not a piece of meat. Im not a slut if I post nude picture. The body is more than sex. And the whole bullshit of playing into mens desires is bullshit, men will sexualise you no matter what clothes or no clothes so they may aswell get to see the ass they can never have. If I ever wanted a mans attention Id send him a far worse picture than what I would share in a private snap. Reading this back I think I was harsh in my judgement but I was honest and dont take anything back.

It seems everyone is thought to deserve body autonomy except us. The incredibly strict rulings in Georgia, Alabama, and Ohio are about policing women, not protecting fetuses or the women themselves. The world is a very closed off, regulated, and pro-shaming place as a woman. As more men escape repercussions of raping while womens lives remain forever changed, we are proving this is acceptable, that we are second class citizens. We are telling our girls to cover up and stay inside, while allowing our boys to act however they choose because they \"grow up slower.\" Take note of every woman who apologizes throughout the day and pay attention to if they are even apologizing for something they need to be sorry for, or if it\\'s simply been engrained in them to not take up too much space, be too loud, or ask too many questions. We\\'ve been conditioning the sexes into their roles for lifetimes without even questioning why and what that does to our society.

And what if we can be inspired, learn, help others, or just laugh out loud through these deep connections. Ive just finished reading Melinda Gates book The Moment Of Lift In her closing paragraphs she talks about connection being more important than equality. And I have to agree, however, in order to understand Melindas point fully, read the book, it is one of the most important books Ive read in recent times. If youd like to attend a event where people come together devoid of labels, so that deep connection can be made through the stories told, then Scroll through to see the date for their next event partnering with one of my favourite brands Some of my best connections have been down to the excellent work and team do.  . . +Male',\n",

Because I refuse to deal with & will walk away from the next salesman who ignores me - after I tell him why!! So pick up your game - women are farmers too - respect us or you wont get your sale/ keep your job/ maintain your ego!! I wont get started on the salesman who inexplicably struck up a monologue of politics & espoused the virtues of One Nation. Are you kidding me?? Know your audience!! Just talk tractors, please!! My husband had that vice grip of lets just leave on my hand as my blood boiled. Are these salesmen even trained in sales, i.e. everyone is a potential customer, not just men?? Thats just my issue with their sales (lack of) skills & personalities - the mass produced marketing material they offer up is so overtly directed at men, its mind numbingly sexist to the point it is hard to find evidence another gender exists!! Oh wait, you might find a token (long haired yet helmeted) female (??) in a quad bike image, passenger of course, not actually in control of the machine!! I do not normally post this kind of thing & slept on my negative (not for the first time, yet this is the latest & I cannot-take-it-anymore) experience with sexism.

Let me just tell you truthfully, there hasnt been a single day in the last two weeks that Ive been in the OR where I havent been called a nurse. The worse part is, when their curiosity gets deeper and they find out I am a surgical resident, the shock on their face is even more offensive. Dont get me wrong, I would be honored to be a nurse, its one of the most important and hardest jobs in healthcare so its not about being a nurse if I was one BUT I am not okay with the assumption that I AM a nurse simply based on my gender or perhaps the fact that I have my hair and make up done at 6 am that leads them to assume. Whatever it is that I am doing that makes me LOOK less like a doctor, is a stereotype in 2019 and it has GOT TO GO. Whether youre a doctor, PA, nurse, pharmacist or any other position in the hospital you should not be categorized based on your appearance. And this is where we ALL can make a when you see discrimination, of any kind, say something and leave a lasting impression. Heres what I mean, in dental school, I was called a hygienist all the time. I usually smiled, and said no I am a dentist and then moved on. I didnt feel like making a fuss about it would do anything. I was mostly silent and I allowed people to continue judging. NOW I no longer do that. When I am wrongly assumed to be something I am not and I feel its on the basis of gender, I smile, say something and then move on. My usually go to technique is sarcasm. The reason why I use humor in response to these stereotypes is because it is too subtle to cause scene but sharp enough to make a point. My mission isnt to fight with everyone, its to breakdown the barriers by first saying something and then eventually doing something. And guess what, everyone has a role to play whether youre a man or woman.',\n",

Sexual positivity promotes the view that sex is healthy for people and that people can experience their sexuality however they like, so long as they engage in safe and consensual practices. Being sex-positive means respecting the sexual freedom, choices and lifestyles of others. It eradicates any hierarchies that assert one kind of sexual practice as better or more righteous than another. Our culture can be a very sex-negative one in which, rather than allowing people to bond over something they all enjoy, social norms favor the act of putting others down for having sex. This is also known as slut-shaming. Theres a tendency to make moral judgments about individuals, mostly women, who have sex, especially if they do it too often.  Polyamory isnt monogamy and it isnt swinging, its being open to having loving relationships with different people of different sexes at the same time, and in that way learning to love yourself, too.

I found the chapter on women in politics particularly Around the world, women are enormously underrepresented in politics... in February 2013, just 20% of parliamentary seats in the world were held by women. With women being largely outnumbered while ideas are being discussed, it comes with the consequence that policy decisions often disproportionately disadvantage women. For example, women make up two thirds of public-sector workers so budget cuts in this area result in an larger increase in unemployment for women than for men. And, since the majority of primary careers of children, the disabled and the elderly are women, around three quarters of all cuts to benefits come out of womens pockets. Previously I didnt pay much attention to politics. But I am now pledging to pay attention and to support the women in government who are fighting to ensure that the impacts on women are taken into consideration! Hopefully one day we will have a government with a which is representative of our population as a whole and people of colour, LGBTQ people and disabled people are also represented!

One thing that really bothers me about how we express displeasure about people (women especially) is how we quickly switch it up to body-shaming and slut-shaming. People just start with the \"see her fallen breasts\", \"fat legs\", \"shapeless\", \"she sleeps around for money\" and recently, \"she has body odor\". Now there is a whole song dedicated to one person about something as sensitive as alleged \"body odor\". Why do we feel the need to be rude or hurtful with our approach to criticizing ourselves and others? Does it make them better or do we just do it to make ourselves feel better? . Sometimes, I try to imagine if I was walking down the street and 5,000 or 10,000 people shouted such things to me. You should too before you go ahead to add to the numbers. The world is stressful enough for us to keep spreading such insensitivity/negativity with reckless abandon, lest we become even worse than the very people we criticize. .

Alya Mooro eloquently describes the pressures experienced by Middle Eastern women, some of which are achingly familiar and others which are unique to her culture. it\\'s published by my employer.)  I just finished a chapter about attitudes to sex. Mooro describes how her mother explained sex to don\\'t do it before marriage or no one will love you. \"Where was any mention of my desires or my feelings in that conversation?\" she asks. Her question made me reflect on my own learning experiences - and how I relied on fiction to fill the knowledge void.  At school, we had (laughingly incomplete) sex ed focused on periods and erections. The baseline was for women the focus was procreation, for men their urges.  Then my father took me aside and told me that society was boys could sleep around but girls couldn\\'t. 11-year-old-me was too naive to question WHO those boys were sleeping with, or why gender inequality was an acceptable status quo.  Years later, when my mother finally sat me down to have \"the talk\", it lasted all of one awkward minute where she obliquely asked if I was being safe. (As always, the onus falls on women.)  No one taught me about love, about consent, about desire. If it weren\\'t for fiction, I would have had an entirely one dimensional view about sex as a currency between genders. Something that my value would be judged on by, as Mooro puts it, the invisible jury of society.  But while books helped plug the void, all-too-often fiction (and especially fantasy) has a warped representation of relationships. It\\'s only now as an adult that I realise how damaging fiction can be in romanticising unacceptable behaviour - particularly in genres targeted at teens. I can\\'t help but wonder how many girls are learning about sex and consent through books like I did... and how much YA authors should take responsibility for changing the narrative of what a healthy relationship looks like.  What good or bad examples of fictional relationships can you think of?',\n",

We went pumpkin picking this morning at Kenyon Hall Farm, which is something we do every year. I will be using mine now to make pumpkin spice cupcakes over the next week or so, which are amazing (if I do say so myself ) . Anyway, whilst we were there, I bumped into someone who caused me some trauma in my past... Long story short, about 7 years ago I was working in a pub in Warrington. I was quite good friends with the assistant manager there for a while, until he started to get a bit too friendly. It started with him being playful, and kind of flirty. That then progressed into him basically assaulting me every time we worked together on shift (which was about 4-5 times a week). Eventually I reported it to the BDM, and was told that it was just banter, and that they were very disappointed in me for wanting to take this further. I had to have a grievance meeting with four middle-aged men. . He was promoted to a general manager, and given his own pub. This was their solution to him sexually assaulting members of staff. . He now lives in the same town as me, and this is not the first time I've ran into him; the last time I had a bad panic attack in my car after seeing him. Today time was the first time he actually saw me. He looked quite shocked, but he more than likely won't dwell on it. I, however, went into panic-mode, my heart was pounding out of my chest, and I felt sick! Tom was there this time, which helped me stay calm, but it's hit me with a horrible low mood, which I'll probably have for the rest of the day. . It was this point in my life that I was diagnosed with a panic disorder, which is why I react the way I do when I see him. I never even feel like this is something I can talk about, because I was made to feel in the wrong. I wasn't even going to post it because I was worried it would seem attention-seeking, but I hate that I have to keep quiet about this stuff, whilst this guy goes about his life, probably not giving a F. .

       " \"I gotta say that tho I'm not for amongst grown women, I am in favor of standing up for yourself. . And tho I'm genuinely tired of all these reality tv shows that are not productive to WOC & much less our children; however, this season of has brought up a good point regarding ...& perhaps a bit of as well. I've thought in the past that Evelyn Lozada showcased a very HS mentality (that's probably becuz that's the highest level of achievement she's ever attained) as she gleefully attacks newcomers on the show. And tho, in the past I've thought that OG can be rather abrasive & arrogant, personality wise...she is no wallflower when it comes to defending herself. And I gotta say, I admire her for that. . Yes, her jabs could be a bit much...but she's right when she's pointed out to the executive producer that there have been women, like Evelyn, who have done physically far worse on the show than her threats. And yet, Evelyn seems to always get a pass. She gets praised & maybe even rewarded for her trashy behavior. Why is that? Is it becuz of a preference in skin tone? I can't honestly believe that the favoritism is alloted to mere friendship. Yeah, loyalty could very well be tied to ratings...but it just goes show...there is no honor among thieves. . Honestly, I'm all the way here & support women who don't easily roll over to be liked & can stand their ground when pitted up against HS bullsh*t. You go, girl. YOU LET THESE HOOKERS KNOW!\",\n",

I went on their site and keyword searched 'all of the women dated' & 'men' and shocker, there weren't ANY articles about how many women men dated, and I scrolled through all 31,131 results. I really wish we could just let women do whatever they so choose to do the same way it's done for men, jeez. K, I'm done 's2k19\",\n",
